/**
 * Per-core CPU load.
 *
 * Read from /proc/stat where the device allows it, which is the load of the whole system. Recent
 * Android versions hide that file from apps, and the idle counters every core keeps in sysfs give
 * the same load the other way around: whatever a core did not spend idle, it spent working. Where
 * even those are missing the patcher's own threads are attributed to the core each of them last
 * ran on, and the numbers then only cover this process, which is what the run is spending anyway.
