# 💊 Universal ReVanced Manager

Universal ReVanced Manager (URV) is an Android manager for patching apps with ReVanced and Morphe in one place. Built from ReVanced Manager, URV expands the full patching workflow with third-party patch bundles, multiple patcher runtimes, saved apps and patch profiles, batch and automatic repatching, flexible APK sources, advanced installers, and standalone APK utilities.

URV supports both ReVanced and Morphe patch ecosystems, rooted and non-rooted workflows, local and remote patch bundle sources, split APK handling, downloader integrations, signature and keystore tools, detailed patching diagnostics, backups, storage controls, and extensive UI customization.

## 💪 Features

URV covers the full patching lifecycle, from choosing an APK source and patch bundle to patching, installing, saving, repatching, automating updates, and managing the files and tools around those workflows.

<details>
<summary><strong>Patch Bundles & Patcher Runtimes</strong></summary>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ReVanced and Morphe in one manager:</strong> Use ReVanced <code>.rvp</code> and Morphe <code>.mpp</code> patch bundles from the same app.</li>
  <li><strong>Third-party patch bundles:</strong> Add compatible local or remote patch bundles, including repository and release-based sources, instead of being limited to the pre-installed bundle.</li>
  <li><strong>Bundle discovery:</strong> Browse the external patch bundle catalog, search it, inspect supported apps and patches, and import bundles directly.</li>
  <li><strong>Remote updates:</strong> Check, download, and background-update remote bundles with progress, stable/pre-release channel handling, per-bundle update controls, and force-redownload support.</li>
  <li><strong>Full changelog history:</strong> View cached patch bundle changelog history with configurable loading and storage limits, plus release links when available.</li>
  <li><strong>Bundle organization:</strong> Rename imported bundles, reorder them, preserve metadata and timestamps, and export/import bundle configurations.</li>
  <li><strong>Official bundle recovery:</strong> Remove the pre-installed Official ReVanced bundle and restore it later from Advanced settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Built-in runtimes:</strong> Current ReVanced and Morphe patching runtimes are bundled with URV.</li>
  <li><strong>ReVanced v21 runtime plugin:</strong> Add the supported ReVanced v21 runtime plugin from a local APK or GitHub source and manage its trust, update channel, installed version, and stored plugin files.</li>
</ul>

  <li><strong>Patch confirmation:</strong> Review selected bundles, patches, options, and relevant configuration before patching.</li>
  <li><strong>Patch profiles:</strong> Save patch selections, option values, target versions, a reusable APK/split source, installer choice, signature workflow, auto-install behavior, and one-tap patching preferences.</li>
  <li><strong>Single and batch patching:</strong> Patch one app or build a multi-app queue with per-app configuration, reordering, cancellation, detailed progress/results, and install-all actions.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic repatching:</strong> Periodically repatch opted-in saved apps when their patch bundles change, with configurable intervals, charging requirements, notifications, and optional Shizuku/Shevery installation.</li>
  <li><strong>Repatch source retention:</strong> Keep the original APK or split archive used for a saved app so future manual, batch, and automatic repatches can reuse it without asking for the source again.</li>
  <li><strong>Split APK preparation:</strong> Patch <code>.apkm</code>, <code>.apks</code>, <code>.xapk</code>, and compatible split archives with selectable modules and cleanup filters for unused languages, densities, and native libraries.</li>
  <li><strong>Install-target-aware patches:</strong> Morphe patch availability can adapt to Standard or Root Mount patching, including required/unavailable patches and optional GmsCore handling.</li>
  <li><strong>Signature metadata workflow:</strong> Optionally clone signature metadata from the original signed input into the final patched APK and remember that choice for saved apps, profiles, batch jobs, and automatic repatching.</li>
  <li><strong>Signing control:</strong> Use the manager keystore, import compatible keystores, or skip patched APK signing where supported.</li>
  <li><strong>Detailed patcher diagnostics:</strong> View elapsed time, app/runtime/device information, selected patches, split/native-library state, and expandable patcher steps and sub-steps.</li>
  <li><strong>Live resource monitoring:</strong> Optional memory, CPU, and storage I/O graphs are available during patching, with compact layouts and peak/current readings.</li>
