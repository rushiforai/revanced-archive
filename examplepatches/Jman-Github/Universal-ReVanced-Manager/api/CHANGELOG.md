# v1.7.1 (2026-01-22)


# ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

The `Discover patch bundles` screen has been updated to use [Brosssh's new API](https://github.com/brosssh/revanced-external-bundles/blob/dev/docs/graphql-examples.md). As a result, you will need to reimport any patch bundles that were added via the Discovery system prior to this release to continue receiving updates from their remote sources.

Additionally, due to a keystore system update, you may need to export and then re-import the Manager’s keystore to resolve a signing error during patching. This is a one-time step after installing version 1.7.1 for the first time.
