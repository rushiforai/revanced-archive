/**
 * VirusTotal API v3 client for scanning downloaded APK files.
 *
 * Free-tier limits: 4 lookups/min, 500/day, 15.5K/month.
 * Upload size: up to 32 MB via POST /files; larger files (up to 650 MB)
 * go through the single-use /files/upload_url endpoint.
 *
 * Flow: compute the file's SHA-256 locally and ask VirusTotal for the
 * existing report first (GET /files/{sha256}). If the file was already
 * analysed — which is the common case for popular APKs — that report is
 * returned instantly without uploading, so we never hit the "file already
 * submitted" dead end. Only files unknown to VirusTotal are uploaded, then
 * the analysis is polled until it completes.
