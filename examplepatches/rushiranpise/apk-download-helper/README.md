Helper for Morphe is a standalone Android helper app for finding and returning original APK files requested by [Morphe Manager](https://github.com/MorpheApp). It receives a package/version request through an Android intent, resolves a matching file from a supported APK source, downloads it when a direct download is available, and returns a readable `content://` URI back to the caller.

This project is independent from the APK source websites listed below. Source availability, package versions, download formats, and region/device access can change at any time.

## Features

### Request handling

- Handles `app.morphe.manager.action.DOWNLOAD_ORIGINAL_APK` requests, including split-archive requests (APK/APKM/APKS/XAPK), ABI hints, compatible version lists, and stock-install requirements.
- Shows the requested app's **real icon** (Android default when not installed), name, package, version, build, format, and ABI in a compact stat-card header. File-format and architecture hints are shown as `+N` pills when multiple values are allowed.
- Lets you narrow a multi-format request to a single file kind (APK / APKM / APKS / XAPK).
- **Reuse instead of re-download**: when a matching file from a previous run still exists (and auto-clear is off), Helper offers it — listing every candidate by source and file size, with the VirusTotal verdict if one exists — so a failed patch or an identical re-request is instant. The offer also works in Fast Mode (which pauses until you decide). "Download new" always wins if you prefer a fresh copy.

### Sources

- Ten sources: **APKMirror, Uptodown, APKPure, APKCombo, Aptoide, Evozi, Mi9, APK Downloader, Aurora, Play**.
- Every source can be individually **enabled/disabled** from Settings → Sources; disabled sources disappear from the picker, manual links, Fast Mode, and the default-source dropdown. If you disable *everything*, Play Store remains as the fallback.
- A **default source** can be set so the picker opens on your preferred provider instead of the first one.
- Each source offers up to four flows: **Manual** (open the site), **Recommended** (exact requested version), **Latest** (newest compatible), and **History** (browse every version).
- The source picker is a compact **dropdown** with a live enabled-source count; selecting a source collapses it so the page stays clean.
- Sources that gate files behind Cloudflare-style challenges open an **in-app captcha browser** (a real WebView); the download it produces is captured back into the helper. VirusTotal scans are offered in this flow too.

### Fast Mode

- One-tap auto-resolve: walks every enabled source in order and returns the file to Morphe without manual taps.
- **Version policy** — requested, latest, or always ask:
  - **Requested version**: finds the exact requested version *and* version code across sources (build mismatches are surfaced for you to accept or skip, never silently downloaded).
  - **Latest version**: fetches the newest version any enabled source offers, and only calls it "latest" when it actually is newer than the requested version.
  - **Always ask**: a simple Requested / Latest choice that appears instantly — no background source scan before you decide.
- Respects the global source toggles; sources that can't deliver a direct APK simply resolve to nothing and the walk moves on.
- Verifies the downloaded file's **real manifest** (package, version name, and version code) before handoff, so a mis-parsed source page can never hand over the wrong or older build.

### VirusTotal scanning

- Optional scanning of every downloaded file before it is returned to Morphe — toggle plus API key in Settings, with **Never / Ask / Always** modes and a link explaining how to get a key.
- **Cached-report reuse**: each file is looked up by its SHA-256 first, so files VirusTotal already analysed are not uploaded again — the result card is labelled **Cached report** vs **Fresh scan**.
- **Split bundles** (APKM/APKS/XAPK) are extracted and each inner APK is scanned individually, since engines often skip large containers; a live progress line names the current APK.
- **Rate-limit aware**: pacing throttles lookups to the free-tier limits (4/min, 500/day) with live quota bars, an automatic countdown + retry when the per-minute cap is hit, and a **Skip wait** action to jump ahead.
- Results show per-engine detections, a tap-to-copy **full SHA-256**, and **Open in VirusTotal**. Verdicts are recorded in the History tab (with cached/fresh badges and a flag filter), and the reuse-offer dialog shows each file's verdict.
- Quota cards appear on the scan flow and the home screen so usage is visible without opening Settings.

### Download & handoff

- **Live speed + ETA** in both the progress notification and the in-app card (`45% · 5.9 MB/s · 0:52 left`), smoothed so readings stay stable.
- Download progress is followed by distinct **extracting / scanning** phases with their own percent bars instead of sitting at a stuck 100%.
- Files are validated against the source-published **SHA-256** when available (shown as a verified badge), and against the real APK manifest before handoff.
- Downloads land in Helper's cache by default (honouring the auto-clear-after-handoff toggle) or as a visible copy in `Downloads/Helper for Morphe`. A storage card shows both sizes and clears each with one tap; a startup sweep clears stale cache and reports how much it freed.

### Find New Apps

- A **live community patch index** (fetched fresh from the morphe-archive JSON on every open — never cached) listing every app with available patches, shown when the request does not come from Morphe.
- Searchable app list with real installed-app icons (Android default when not installed), per-app **source count**, install-state filters (All / Installed / Not installed), **favourites** that survive refreshes, and sort options (A–Z, Z–A, recently added, recently updated, most sources).
- Each app's detail groups patches **per source** in collapsible lists, with "Add to Morphe" actions that deep-link into the manager and an Open in Play Store shortcut.
- Includes the community disclaimer: the index is community-maintained, bundles are not individually verified, and neither Morphe nor this app's developer is responsible for third-party patches.

### Appearance, DNS & logs

- **Themes**: dark, light, or follow-the-system, plus optional **Material You** wallpaper-tinted accents and surfaces (Android 12+). A quick theme toggle lives in the home header.
- **AdGuard DNS**: resolve app traffic through AdGuard DNS to block ads/trackers on download pages and in the captcha browser, with automatic fallback to the system resolver on failure.
- **Tabs in Settings** (Settings / Health / History / Logs): per-source health checks, every past hand-off (with scan verdicts), and the full in-app request + HTTP log — every URL, status code, redirect, and timing — with a **Share** button exporting it for bug reports (app version and device info included). Logcat mirroring is optional.

## Helper Settings

- **Save downloads**: cache (honouring auto-clear) or a visible copy in `Downloads/Helper for Morphe`; a storage card shows cache and Downloads sizes and clears both with one tap.
- **Connection**: Wi-Fi only, mobile data only, or both.
- **Sources**: toggle each APK source, or set a **default source**.
- **Fast Mode**: enable auto-resolve and choose the version policy (Requested / Latest / Always ask).
- **Security**: VirusTotal scanning with API key and scan mode.
- **AdGuard DNS**: on/off.
- **Appearance**: System / Dark / Light and Material You colors.
- **Logging**: mirror request/HTTP details to Logcat.

Temporary hand-off is the default because Morphe Manager copies the returned APK URI into its own private workspace before patching.

## Debugging & Bug Reports

When a source fails to resolve or a download stalls, the **Logs** tab shows the full story — the request data, every URL fetched, HTTP status codes, redirects, and timing — with no adb needed. Use **Share** to export the log (including the app/device info) to any app.

GitHub issues use a bug report template that asks for this exported log, so reports arrive with the exact failing request and HTTP trace. A feature-request template is also provided.

## Intent Contract

Request action:

```text
app.morphe.manager.action.DOWNLOAD_ORIGINAL_APK
```

Important request extras:

```text
app.morphe.manager.extra.CALLER_PACKAGE
app.morphe.manager.extra.PROTOCOL_VERSION
app.morphe.manager.extra.PACKAGE_NAME
app.morphe.manager.extra.APP_NAME
app.morphe.manager.extra.VERSION_NAME
app.morphe.manager.extra.VERSION_CODES
app.morphe.manager.extra.COMPATIBLE_VERSION_NAMES
app.morphe.manager.extra.SUPPORTED_ABIS
app.morphe.manager.extra.FILE_TYPE
app.morphe.manager.extra.ALLOW_SPLIT_ARCHIVE
app.morphe.manager.extra.STOCK_INSTALL_REQUIRED
app.morphe.manager.extra.FALLBACK_WEB_URL
```

The helper also accepts older local draft keys for compatibility, including `REQUESTED_FILE_TYPE`, `INSTALL_STOCK_AFTER_DOWNLOAD`, `VERSION_CODE`, `COMPATIBLE_VERSION_CODES`, and `SOURCE_HINT_URLS`.

Successful result:

- `Activity.RESULT_OK`
- `Intent.data` points to the downloaded file URI
- `Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` is granted to the caller

## App Icon

The launcher icon (green ribbon "M" over a dark forest-green tile) lives as the master at `tools/app_icon_source.png`; `tools/make_icon.py` regenerates every legacy and adaptive density from it:

```powershell
python tools\make_icon.py
```

## Release Signing

Release APKs must be signed with a private release certificate. Debug signing is only for local test builds and must not be used for public releases.

GitHub Actions expects these repository secrets:

- `HELPER_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64`: base64-encoded release keystore
- `HELPER_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD`
- `HELPER_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`
- `HELPER_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`

For local release builds, place the same values in `local.properties` or pass them as Gradle properties/environment variables. Do not commit keystores or signing passwords.

## Source Audit Script

Use `tools/audit_helper_sources.py` to test source availability for every app declared in a Morphe `Constants.kt` file without launching the Android app:

```powershell
python tools\audit_helper_sources.py --output reports\source-audit.csv
```

Useful targeted checks:

```powershell
python tools\audit_helper_sources.py --package club.boxbox.android --sources apkpure,aptoide,apkcombo
python tools\audit_helper_sources.py --limit 20 --sources apkmirror,uptodown,apkpure,apkcombo,aptoide
```

The CSV/JSON output reports whether each source matched the requested version, only found latest, found the wrong file format, or failed to resolve the package.

## Notes

- Only download apps you are allowed to access.
- This helper does not bypass paid apps, license checks, account restrictions, or DRM.
- Always verify downloaded files before installing them on a device you care about.
- Source matching is best-effort because APK providers can change their sites and APIs without notice.
