## 💪 Features

### 🔄 Automatic Bundle & Patch Updates
Scheduled jobs continuously monitor and update all bundles and their patches, ensuring you always have access to the latest versions without manual intervention.

### [🎯 GraphQL Query Interface](https://cloud.hasura.io/public-graphiql/?endpoint=https%3A%2F%2Frevanced-external-bundles.brosssh.com%2Fhasura%2Fv1%2Fgraphql)
Powerful GraphQL endpoint allowing you to fetch exactly the data you need with flexible, nested queries. Check out the [GraphQL examples documentation](docs/graphql-examples.md).

### [🔌 REST API with Swagger Documentation](https://revanced-external-bundles.brosssh.com/swagger/index.html)
Comprehensive RESTful endpoints with interactive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for easy integration and testing. Browse and query bundles, patches, and their metadata through well-documented HTTP endpoints.

### [🌐 Interactive Web Interface](https://revanced-external-bundles.brosssh.com/)
User-friendly website to explore available bundles and their patches visually. Built on top of the REST API, providing an intuitive way to discover and understand patch compatibility and features.
> [!WARNING]  
> The Web Interface is **NOT** the primary goal of this project. Better Web Interfaces are welcome, I personally have no interest in designing a proper website.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

### Adding or disabling a bundle source

Bundle sources are tracked in [`src/main/resources/sources.toml`](src/main/resources/sources.toml). Add a canonical repository URL to that file, or set `enabled = false` to pause refreshes while preserving its cached bundles and patches. Removing an entry also soft-disables it at the next backend start; source data is never deleted automatically.

Copy the [source update pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/source-update.md) into the pull request description and complete it before submitting.

Validate manifest changes before opening a pull request:

```shell
./gradlew validateSources
```

Patcher runtime compatibility is configured in [`patcher-runtimes.toml`](src/main/resources/patcher-runtimes.toml) using SemVer ranges powered by [semver4j](https://github.com/semver4j/semver4j). See the [runtime guide](docs/patcher-runtimes.md) for details.
