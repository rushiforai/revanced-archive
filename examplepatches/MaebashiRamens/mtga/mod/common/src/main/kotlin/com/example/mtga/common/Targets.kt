/**
 * Hook / patch coordinates for Truth Social, keyed by app version.
 *
 * R8 renames classes and methods on every build, so v1.24.8 names won't
 * match v1.25.0. One [TargetSet] per tested version. At hook init we look up
 * the current versionCode and pick the matching set; on a miss we fall back to
 * [latest], warn the user, and rely on each hook's own try/catch (and the
 * [FallbackResolver] dynamic-discovery path) to degrade gracefully rather than
 * crash the host.
 *
 * ## Calibration workflow (adding a new version)
 *
 * 1. Drop the apkmirror `.apkm` bundle into the project root.
 * 2. `unzip` it; record `sha256sum base.apk` (goes into [BuildId]).
 * 3. `nix develop --command jadx --no-res -d /tmp/jadx_<v> /tmp/<v>/base.apk`.
 *    [resStringHelpCenter] can be read with `aapt2 dump resources`; `--no-res`
 *    is fine for class discovery.
 * 4. For each [TargetSet] field, follow its `HOW TO LOCATE` note. Most fields
 *    stay identical between minor releases.
 *
 *    JADX file-name vs JVM class name: jadx renames class files when the
 *    original would collide on a case-insensitive filesystem (`e.java` vs
 *    `E.java`). The DEX/JVM class name is unchanged — read the
 *    `/* JADX INFO: renamed from: <pkg>.<name> */` marker near the top.
 *    Always feed the original DEX name into [ClassTarget], never jadx's
 *    display name (`C1744e`).
 *
 * 5. Verify each method-name field. R8 renames methods independently of
 *    their owning class.
 * 6. Append a new `TargetsV<X_Y_Z>` constant and register it in [knownVersions].
 * 7. `./gradlew :mod:app:assembleDebug` and `nix run .#build-patches`.
 *
 * ## Anchor-based self-healing
 *
 * Some classes carry a stable string in their own bytecode (the header / route
 * literal in their `HOW TO LOCATE` note); those are registered once, version-
 * independently, in [TargetAnchors]. The patch vector resolves them
 * calibrated-first, anchor-fallback (`resolveClassDescriptor`), so an
 * uncalibrated build still locates them without a fresh [ClassTarget] — the
 * obfuscated name here is the fast path, not the only path. Anchors never
 * replace calibration (most symbols have no own-body string to key on); they
 * just shrink what a new release strictly requires.

// correct for these builds.

// v1.26.2 churn:
//   - Compose Navigation rewrite: bottom-nav tabs moved from `C6.g.a()` to
//     static fields on `Zc.j` (predictions list `a`, chats list `b`). The
//     AI tab was removed entirely — `bottomNavAiTab` is null. New tab
//     classes live as `Zc.c..h` keyed by route id.
//   - `Feed` / `Features` data models moved from `com.truthsocial.app` to
//     `com.truthsocial.core`. `Features` gained `predictionsEnabled` (idx 8)
//     and `videoScrollingEnabled` (idx 9); indices 0–7 unchanged.
//   - AdQueueManager refactor: dropped `b()` (fetchAd). `c()` is now a
//     suspend function returning `List<? extends ke.j>` (we replace with
//     empty list); `e(timelineId, adIndexes, zone, maxListSize, indexOffset)`
//     is the void writer (we no-op).
//   - AppStateManagerImpl tab-select methods drifted from `c/e` to `b/j`;
//     clear-badge method from `g` to `e`.
//   - Sidebar item renderer split from a single `j()` into `m()` + `n()`.
//   - NavDrawerAvatar gem badge methods renamed `k/m` → `i/j`.
//   - Account drawer gem methods renamed `M/b0` → `J0/d0`.
//   - `preferencesBuilder`, `composerViewModel`, `kotlinFunction0`,
//     `kotlinUnit` not re-verified for v1.26.2 (low priority for the
//     features that consume them). Values inherited from v1.26.1 — may be
