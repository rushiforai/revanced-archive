# BannerHub ReVanced — GameHub 6.0 Port Progress Log

## 2026-07-29 — 🔓 pcengine plugin signature bypass — 2 patches written (branch `feature/pcengine-signature-bypass`)

Since 6.1.0 loads the PC emulator as a downloadable plugin whose signing cert must equal the HOST's, and every BannerHub build is re-signed with our own key, the genuine XiaoJi-signed plugin is rejected → no emulator. Device-proven via `pc_engine_plugin_manager_journal.json` (11× `Verification` failures 「插件签名与宿主不一致」). Two independent host-side gates, both patched:

1. **`PcEngineValidationStrategyPatch`** (`com/combo` framework gate). Forces `com.combo.core.model.PluginFrameworkContext.getValidationStrategy()` to return `ValidationStrategy.Insecure` (the enum's own permissive value; ships `Strict`). Non-obfuscated class/method → stable anchor. Injects `sget-object p0, …ValidationStrategy;->Insecure… ; return-object p0` at head (method is `.locals 0`, p0=this, safe to overwrite before return).
2. **`PcEnginePluginSignatureCheckPatch`** (pcengine manager's own gate, NOT governed by ValidationStrategy). The obfuscated manager method (`xy5.G0(File)Ljava/lang/String;` on 6.1.0) returns null on cert-match / the mismatch message otherwise; its sole caller branches `if-eqz`. Force it to return null → always "match". Anchored on the globally-unique mismatch string `插件签名与宿主不一致 host=` (survives R8 renames). Injects `const/4 v0, 0x0 ; return-object v0` at head (`.locals 12`).

Both are `bytecodePatch` auto-discovered (no registry). Kept as 2 separate patches so the first CI run confirms each anchor independently. ⚠️ Device-test caveat: a fresh install must reach the plugin-download step; login bypass is NOT re-derived on 610 yet, so stock XiaoJi login is required to trigger the download before the bypass can be observed loading it.

**✅ BUILD GREEN + DELIVERED 2026-07-29.** Run `30452215986` off `feature/pcengine-signature-bypass` `b6ced04`, version `1.0.0-610-pre1`, artifacts-only. **Both patches applied on ALL 9 variants** — CI log: `INFO: "PC engine plugin — bypass manager signature check" succeeded` + `INFO: "PC engine plugin — force Insecure validation" succeeded`, zero SEVERE. Anchors correct. Delivered **Genshin** variant to `/sdcard/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.0.0-610-pre1-Patched-Genshin.apk`, md5 `50137ab626bb9f3ddcfbc60f8ec6b063`, cert `10895a31…894ce0ba` (our stable key). (Many OTHER patches SEVERE-skipped as expected — 610 fingerprints not re-derived yet — but the build continues and produces working APKs.)

**🔑 THREE gates on the plugin, not two (found while evaluating "re-sign the plugin to match host" idea):** besides the 2 signature checks we patched, the manager ALSO computes the downloaded plugin's SHA-256 and compares it to the value in the server manifest (`插件 SHA-256 校验失败 expected=`, xy5:9362; manifest `PcEnginePluginVersion` carries `sha256`+`md5`+`downloadUrl`). **Consequence:** re-signing the plugin changes its bytes → new sha256 → trips the hash gate too, so "just drop a re-signed plugin in `plugin_packages/`" does NOT work without ALSO serving a matching manifest (customVersionUrl / our endpoint). This is why **patching the host wins**: the app downloads the GENUINE plugin (sha256 ✓, XiaoJi sig — now unchecked), satisfying/bypassing all 3 gates with zero plugin hosting. Re-signing the plugin is strictly more infra (host + plugin + manifest) and only works paired with a host WE sign anyway.
⛔ **Cannot help the user's CURRENTLY-installed host** (cert `a40da80a…`, unknown origin): we don't hold that private key, so we can neither re-sign a matching plugin nor re-sign a patched host to update it in place. Test path = uninstall the `a40da80a` build, install this `10895a31` patched build fresh → it re-downloads the genuine plugin → patched host accepts it.

## 2026-07-29 — ✅ RESOLVED: 6.1.0 moved the whole PC emulator into a **downloadable DexClassLoader plugin** (`:pcengine`)

Answers the "where did the runtime go" question from the onboarding entry below. This is an **architecture change, not an R8 reshuffle** — 6.1.0 is not a normal base bump.

### What upstream did
GameHub 6.1.0 extracted the entire PC emulation engine out of the APK and turned it into a **downloadable, hash-verified plugin** loaded via `DexClassLoader` into a dedicated **`:pcengine`** process.

Evidence, all from `~/gh610-apktool-d` vs `~/gh609-apktool-d`:

| | 6.0.9 | 6.1.0 |
|---|---|---|
| `com.xiaoji.egggame.plugin.pcengine.host.*` | **0 classes** | **5** (new) |
| `com/combo/**` plugin framework | absent | **49 classes** (`core/runtime/{loader,installer,app}`, activity/service/provider/receiver proxies) |
| `DexClassLoader` uses | **0** | 6 — incl. `com/combo/core/runtime/loader/PluginClassLoader extends DexClassLoader` |
| `com/winemu/**` classes | 39 | **3** (`CabFile`, `gamepad/GamepadServerManager`, `openapi/Config`) |
| `com/xiaoji/egggame/common/winemu/**` | **198** | **1** (`service/EmuFileService`) |
| `android:process=":pcengine"` | — | **new**, hosts 3 activities + 1 service |
| native runtime `.so` | winemu/xserver/vfs/gpuinfo present | **all 4 removed** (6.71 MB) |

- **`WineActivity` is now an `<activity-alias>`** → `LegacyPcEngineActivityTrampoline`. The real entry points are `PcEnginePluginHostActivity` / `…SettingsHostActivity` / `…DependencyInstallHostActivity`, all in `:pcengine`.
- **`PcEnginePluginHostService`** drives install with actions `…host.action.INSTALL_PLUGIN` / `COMMIT_PLUGIN_INSTALL` / `HEALTH_PROBE` and extras `INSTALL_CANDIDATE_PATH`, `INSTALL_EXPECTED_ABI`, `INSTALL_EXPECTED_PLUGIN_ID`, `INSTALL_EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION`, **`INSTALL_EXPECTED_SHA256`**, `INSTALL_OPERATION_ID`.
- **`com.winemu.openapi.Config`** (new, `Parcelable` + `CREATOR`) is the host↔plugin API boundary — it carries the entire launch config: `runMode, exePath, gameRootDir, steamAppId, box64Config, fexConfig, gpuDriver, gpuConfig, dllOverrides, resolution, enableESync, enableMangoHUD, inGameHud, hostCoreMask, envVars, localeCode, …`. Built by `zmv.m(Context,String,String,y63,List)` and `xfu`; consumed by `y9.<init>(Context, Config, m35, wsu)`. Parcelable because it crosses into `:pcengine`.
- **`EmuFileService`** (the sole survivor of the 198-class `common/winemu` package) is the downloader — handles `download_ext_info` / `checkDownloadInfo`.
- Full download/install/update UX already exists as strings: `common_game_pc_engine_action_{download,installing,update}`, `…install_required_{launch_game,download_game,open_settings}`, `…compat_update_{title,message,confirm,cancel}`, `…md5_label`, `…launch_failed`.

Residual `System.loadLibrary("winemu")` in `GamepadServerManager` and the `nativeLibraryDir/libvfs.so` path built in `zmv.m` (alongside `WINEMU_ROOT_FS`, `getDataDir()`) are **leftovers pointing at the app's own lib dir**, where those files no longer exist — consistent with the engine having moved out from under them.

### Ruled out along the way
Not a split/asset-pack base APK (no split markers; `lib/arm64-v8a/` still ships 21 other `.so`). Not a companion app (`EmuFileService` is `exported="false"`; the only `createPackageContext` calls target Google Play Services and Huawei HMS). Not a stripped/repacked file (surgical removal of 36 winemu + 197 common/winemu Kotlin classes, dex 5→4, compileSdk 36→37 — a repacker does none of that).

### 🔴 What this means for BannerHub — read before planning 610
1. **The Worker almost certainly has to serve the plugin.** Our Redirect-catalog-API patch points the app at the BannerHub Worker. If the pcengine plugin is fetched through the catalog, then **patched 6.1.0 has no emulator at all until the Worker serves it** — and `INSTALL_EXPECTED_SHA256` + `INSTALL_EXPECTED_PLUGIN_ID` + `INSTALL_EXPECTED_ABI` + `INSTALL_EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION` mean we must serve the **genuine artifact**, not a substitute. **Where the plugin URL comes from is the next thing to establish** (not yet traced).
2. **Patches whose upstream anchors no longer exist in the APK at all:**
   - **Offline component picker** — `com/xiaoji/egggame/common/winemu/bean/{ComponentType,EnvLayerEntity}` gone with the other 197. (This is the one that first worked on 609.)
   - **GPU Spoof** — `Lcom/winemu/core/utils/EnvVars;` gone.
   - **Legacy GLES2 renderer** — `com/winemu/core/server/XServer` gone.
   - HUD / frame-gen / trans_layer (`Box64Config`, `FEXConfig`, `TemplateFexConfig`) all gone.
   These are no longer re-derivation targets — whatever they did now happens **inside the plugin**, which is not ours to patch by these means.
3. **Likely still portable** (app-shell, untouched by the split): Bypass login, Debug logging, Redirect catalog API + `/v6` prefix, Explore tab hijack, the menu/keystone family, privacy/analytics stubs, GOG, Steam chat/voice overlay.
4. **PC-accurate vibration is ambiguous:** `GamepadServerManager` survives in the main APK with our hook site intact, but the winebus disk-patch targets a container whose ownership has moved.

### Repo state
Branch **`gamehub-610-build`** created off `gamehub-609-build` and pushed. `ci(610)` bumps `release.yml` to `base-apk-610`/`GameHub_6.1.0.apk`; `patches(610)` bumps `GAMEHUB_VERSION` 6.0.9→6.1.0 (no stray 6.0.9 pins; the 10 by-design 6.0.4 pins untouched). YAML validated. **No smoke-test dispatch yet** — a SEVERE list is not the useful next artifact while item 1 above is open. jadx pass done: `~/gamehub-6.1.0-jadx` (22,480 files, 120 errors = normal R8 noise; 609 had 143).

## 2026-07-29 — 📦 GameHub **6.1.0** base APK onboarded (`base-apk-610`) — ⚠️ NATIVE EMULATION RUNTIME IS NOT IN THE APK

Upstream shipped **6.1.0 / versionCode 122** (609 was 121 — sequential, no skip this time). Source APK supplied by user from SD backup `/storage/7B7F-E3AA/APK Backups/Gamehub/v6/GameHub_6.1.0.apk`, copied to `~/GameHub_6.1.0.apk`.

| | 6.0.9 | 6.1.0 |
|---|---|---|
| versionCode | 121 | **122** |
| size | 86,643,386 | **76,567,271** (−10,076,115, −11.6%) |
| minSdk / targetSdk / compileSdk | 29 / 36 / 36 | 29 / 36 / **37** |
| dex files | 5 | **4** |
| `.so` count (arm64-v8a, only ABI) | 25 | **21** |
| md5 | `ae6f18b5…` | `ad428649b1b7d779e8093c7d27407193` |
| sha256 | — | `d101aefc02b4a1ada85cbfe03a4fec466f382c88c212f3c70a16e9f8b1c7ee7f` |

**Release `base-apk-610` published** (shell first, then `gh release upload` separately per the 609 rollback lesson — the inline-asset path is still not to be used). Asset verified at exactly 76,567,271 bytes, `state=uploaded`. `unzip -t` clean.

### 🚨 THE HEADLINE: four native runtime libs were REMOVED

Present in 6.0.9, **absent from 6.1.0** (7,035,352 bytes = 6.71 MB of the 10 MB shrink):

| lib | 6.0.9 size | role |
|---|---|---|
| `libxserver.so` | 5,065,592 | the X server |
| `libvfs.so` | 969,496 | virtual filesystem |
| `libwinemu.so` | 658,320 | **the Wine emulation core** (also the FpsLimit host) |
| `libgpuinfo.so` | 341,944 | GPU introspection |

Verified absent, not relocated: **zero** hits for `winemu|xserver|libvfs|gpuinfo` anywhere else in the zip (assets, unknown/, any ABI). Only `arm64-v8a` exists as an ABI dir, same as 609. Manifest has **no** split / asset-pack / dynamic-feature markers — plain single APK, so this is not Play Asset Delivery.

**But the loader call survives:** `com/winemu/core/gamepad/GamepadServerManager` still runs `System.loadLibrary("winemu")`, and the whole `com/winemu/core/**` Java layer plus the `com.xiaoji.egggame.common.winemu_core` Compose string bundles are intact. `System.load` (path-based) call sites in 610 all belong to JNA / Tencent IM / liteav / QQ-security loaders — **no winemu-from-disk loader found**. Tencent TRTC voice libs from 609 (`libImSDK`/`libliteavsdk`/`libtxffmpeg`/`libtxsoundtouch`) are all still shipped, so the shrink is NOT the 609 Team-Room stack coming back out.

**⚠️ UNRESOLVED — this is the first thing the 610 diff must bottom out.** `System.loadLibrary` only searches `nativeLibraryDir`, which the app cannot write to, so a component downloaded into `files/` could not satisfy that call as-is. Candidate explanations, none yet confirmed: (a) the runtime moved into the server-driven **component/catalog** pipeline (fits their architecture — imagefs, wine containers, DXVK, Turnip, FEX all already arrive that way) with some loader change not yet located; (b) the PC path pivoted toward cloud (`libhaima_rtc_so.so`, 8.2 MB Haima cloud-gaming RTC, still shipped; there is a `features.cloud/drawable/feature_winemu_ic_ingame_setting_tab.xml`); (c) this build is region/channel-specific. **Do not start the patch re-derivation worklist until this is answered** — if the runtime now arrives via the catalog, our Redirect-catalog-API patch means the **BannerHub Worker must serve it** or patched builds have no emulator at all.

**Authenticity:** `unzip -t` clean, resources + manifest decode cleanly, coherent AGP metadata, compileSdk bumped 36→37 (a repacker would not do that). NOTE: a v1-signature cert comparison against 609 was attempted and was **vacuous** — both APKs are v2/v3-signed only, so there are no `META-INF/*.RSA` files to compare. Signature identity vs. 609 is therefore **not** established here; verify with `apksigner verify --print-certs` on a machine where the SDK build-tools run (the Termux `aapt2`/`apksigner` binaries fail under PRoot — missing ELF interpreter).

Decompiled: `apktool → ~/gh610-apktool-d` (4 smali dirs, exit 0). jadx pass not yet run. **Branch `gamehub-610-build` NOT yet created** — held pending the runtime-delivery question above.

## 2026-07-29 — 🩹 README download badges were frozen since the 609 cut (badge workflow still pinned to 608)

**Symptom:** the README badges on the default branch had read **59k total / "0" latest** since 2026-06-18 — i.e. the front page advertised zero downloads for `v1.0.0-609` for six weeks.

**Cause:** `.github/workflows/update-badges.yml` pins its checkout + push target to a branch explicitly (the `release: published` event checks out the *tag*, so the branch can't be inferred). That pin was still `gamehub-608-build` from when the badge system was built on the 608 line. When the default branch moved to `gamehub-609-build` at the 609 stable cut, the README's two `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs moved with it — but the workflow did not. The hourly cron kept computing correct numbers and committing them to `gamehub-608-build`, which nothing reads. Real values on 608 at time of fix: **117k total / 48k latest**.

**Fix:** `BADGE_BRANCH` env → `gamehub-609-build`, and the checkout step now reads `ref: ${{ env.BADGE_BRANCH }}` instead of repeating the literal — one place to edit instead of two that can silently disagree. Comment above the env now names this as a base-line-bump chore alongside the README raw URLs.

**⚠️ Base-bump checklist item:** every new `gamehub-6XX-build` default branch must update `BADGE_BRANCH` **and** the two README badge URLs together. This was already a recorded gotcha when the badge endpoint was introduced; the 609 swap just never triggered it. Stale badge data is silent — the workflow stays green either way, so nothing surfaces the drift.

## 2026-07-02 — 🔓 Secret-leak audit: `bh_gog_debug.txt` writes GOG credentials to shared storage (FIX PENDING)

**Trigger:** evaluating whether gamehub-lite's v5.1.7→5.1.8 "redact Steam auth tokens from logs" fix (a `SensitiveLogRedactor` hooked into logcat sinks) should be ported to v6. Answer: **no** — v6's exposure is a *file*, not logcat.

**Method:** on-device inspection of the installed v6 variant (`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`, a disguised package name — 58 MB, NOT real Genshin) via the `getlog` root bridge (daemon `127.0.0.1:8765`; note plain `su`/magiskd was down but the bridge gives `uid=0 context=u:r:magisk:s0`).

**Findings:**
- **logcat = CLEAN.** 5000-line root, package-filtered pull → 0 token/secret hits. A logcat redactor would have nothing to redact here.
- **THE LEAK = `bh_gog_debug.txt`.** Written by our own extension code to **external, other-app-readable** storage (`/sdcard/Android/data/<pkg>/files/bh_gog_debug.txt`, group `ext_data_rw`). 68-line file, **4 sensitive items (device-confirmed)**:
  1. GOG **`clientSecret`** (`6934b68e…bca8e195`, file-line 16) — from `GogDownloadManager.java:278` dumping the first 300 chars of the decompressed build manifest (embeds clientId+clientSecret).
  2. **Fastly CDN secure-link `token`** (`…token=0b51d28…`, time-limited by `nva` expiry) — `:357` + full signed URLs at `:365`/`:391`.
  3. **gcdn.co `wsSecret`+`wsTime`** (`wsSecret=62369653…`) — `:365`/`:391`.
  4. `clientId` (semi-public, completes the credential).
  - OAuth access_token is **NOT** leaked (line 141 writes only `token OK` status). Sink = `writeDebug()` @ `:222-232` via `ctx.getExternalFilesDir(null)`.
- **Creation chain (it's ours, not the base):** GOG store added by patches `GogManifestPatch`/`GogMenuRowPatch`/`GogLibraryCardPatch` → UI → `BhDownloadService.java:327` → `GogDownloadManager.startDownload()` (builds `dbg` @ :121) → `writeDebug()` at every exit path (:158,175,186,190,207,211,217). Compiled **extension Java** (classes dex), not a patch resource. **UNCONDITIONAL — no DEBUG/BuildConfig gate** (grep empty): a dev diagnostic from the Gen1/Gen2 download debugging that shipped always-on in every variant.
- **Steam = CLEAN.** Base XiaoJi steamkit keeps real secrets (`access_token`/`login_key`/`guard_data`/`web_token`/`steam_id`) in `files/steam_data/steamkit/accounts.json` mode 0600 **app-private** — correct. `steam-trace.log` (0600) = depot-download telemetry only (its "token"/"password" hits were HL2 asset filenames like `createtokendialog.res`). `bh_steam_chat.xml` (our feature) = UI settings only. No Steam secret on shared storage.

**FIX (not yet applied):** best = **gate `writeDebug` behind a debug flag, off in release** (it's a dev diagnostic → stops writing in prod). Keep-for-support alternative = redact `clientSecret`/`token=`/`wsSecret` from the manifest snippet (:278) + cdn URLs (:365/:391) before append **and** write to app-private `getFilesDir()` (:224) instead of external. Java extension edit + extension-dex rebuild (not smali/resource), low-risk. Verify on a fresh GOG sync via the bridge. TODO: check the other 8 variant packages for the same file on their shared storage.

## 2026-06-08 — 🔒 Plan 11: Disable Firebase auto-init (Crashlytics runtime-reenable fix) — MERGED to `gamehub-608-build` `61a2a3f`

Live DNS/SNI captures (via the new DNSWatch root app) of patched vs stock 6.0.8 showed BannerHub still
contacting `firebase-settings.crashlytics.com`, `firebaselogging-pa.googleapis.com` (datatransport/Firelog)
and `firebaseinstallations.googleapis.com`. **Root cause:** `com.xiaoji.egggame.AndroidApp`'s Firebase-setup
helper (`a()V`, from onCreate) **re-enables Crashlytics collection at runtime** (`firebase_crashlytics_collection_enabled=true`
+ `firebase_data_collection_default_enabled=true` written to SDK prefs), **overriding** our manifest
`DisableCrashlyticsPatch` flag — so Crashlytics was actually live. (Analytics stayed dead: `_collection_deactivated`
is a hard manifest flag the app can't override → no `app-measurement.com`.) Note 6.0.8 ships **no**
`FirebaseInitProvider`; Firebase discovers via `ComponentDiscoveryService` + the app inits FirebaseApp itself.

**Patch `DisableFirebaseAutoInitPatch.kt`** (bytecode): in the AndroidApp method holding the stable string
`"FirebaseCrashlytics component is not present."`, insert `return-void` before the first `monitor-enter` — i.e.
**after** `FirebaseApp.initializeApp`/`getInstance` (kept: a later coroutine `hgf.a`/`zo` needs it) and **before**
the collection re-enable. Manifest `false` then holds → Crashlytics off → settings/Firelog/FID all stop.

**3 build iterations to get it right** (device-tested each via root bridge + DNSWatch):
pre1 (disable ComponentDiscoveryService) → crash `FirebaseCrashlytics component is not present`; pre2 (stub whole
`a()`) → crash `Default FirebaseApp is not initialized`; **pre3 ✅** (return after init/before re-enable) → app
launches, all 3 Firebase hosts **gone** from app-attributed traffic; `play.googleapis.com` Firebase-share also
dropped (GMS-share unpatched — system app). Merged `--no-ff` to `gamehub-608-build` `61a2a3f` with PRIVACY.md
correction (Crashlytics row + residuals moved to "killed").

🏁 **STABLE SHIPPED `v1.2.0-608` (Latest)** — run `27155961298` (first dispatch cancelled: release notes/README
were still on 1.1.0-608; refreshed `release.yml` body + README "What's new in v1.2.0-608" → Plan 11 headline,
Steam-chat overlay folded to carryover, `gen_whatsnew` regenerated the Explore card, commit `b4c81e5`, then
re-dispatched). 13 assets (9 APK + bh_explore.json + 3 .rvp), stable keystore, Normal apk md5 `f372cd2c`. Release
notes render the Firebase fix correctly. Website `bannerhub-site` updated + Pages-deployed live (`dc54ba5`):
v6 page changelog + version badges (v1.2.0-608) + v6-privacy page (Plan 11 kill row, residual cards → killed,
vgabc rows corrected to loopback redirect, 6.0.8 A/B note).


## 2026-06-06 — 🚀 GameHub 6.0.7 (vc118) port begun on `gamehub-607-build`

Upstream shipped **GameHub 6.0.7** (vc118, 75.97 MB — a −46% size pass; full decompile/map in
`gamehub_reports/GAMEHUB_607_MASTER_MAP.md`). Porting the v6 patch set off 6.0.4.

**Base setup:** base APK uploaded as release **`base-apk-607`** (`GameHub_6.0.7.apk`, md5 `62a84f75…`,
75,970,858 B). Branch **`gamehub-607-build`** cut from `origin/gamehub-604-build` (`b84b8f3`) and made the
repo **default branch**. CI repointed: `release.yml` fetches/patches `GameHub_6.0.7.apk` from `base-apk-607`
(commit **`4274d4b`**, 5 refs). `Constants.kt` `GAMEHUB_VERSION` flipped 6.0.4→6.0.7 (commit **`211930e`**) so
patches execute instead of being skipped as version-incompatible.

**Dry-run methodology:** `workflow_dispatch` on `release.yml` (artifact-only, `stable=false`), then parse the
Normal-variant "Apply patches" log for `INFO:"X" succeeded` vs `SEVERE:"X" failed`. Patches are R8-letter /
fingerprint based; only those whose target code changed break.

| Dry run | Applied / Failed | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| fp1 ([27068312462](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27068312462)) | 25 / 24 | baseline after version flip; 17 root + 7 cascade. Cascades trace to 2 roots (Per-game menu id capture → 6 menu rows; Redirect catalog → Prefix API). |
| fp2 ([27068884039](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27068884039)) | 27 / 22 | **Bypass login + Redirect catalog API fixed.** Prefix API surfaced as its own break (was masked as a cascade). |
| fp3 ([27069203380](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27069203380)) | **29 / 20** | **Offline component picker + Prefix API path both applied.** 20 remain (Per-game-menu-id root + its 6 cascades + 13 direct). Awaiting device re-test of the DXVK/VKD3D/Box64/FEXCore/driver pickers. |

**Patches fixed so far (with 6.0.7 R8 re-derivation):**
- **Redirect catalog API** (commit **`359c4b0`**): env enum `Lesj;`→`Lnnh;` (unique class holding
  `landscape-api-cn/oversea.vgabc.com` in `<clinit>`). Clears Prefix-API cascade.
- **Bypass login** (commit **`e6c8a88`**): full auth-chain reshuffle — method names a..h preserved, only class
  letters + userid (`e`→`g`) + 2nd nav gate (`r`→`s`) changed: `AUTH_IMPL Ljt0;→Lfw0;`, `AUTH_INTERFACE
  Ldt0;→Lcw0;`, `AUTH_TOKEN Lwpm;→Ln2l;`, `GAME_LIB_REPO Lvu7;→Lam7;`, `NAVIGATOR Lgme;→Lg8d;`, login route
  `Lsa0;→Lfb0;` (AuthLoginAll). Java extensions updated: FakeStateFlow `akk/ozh/dge→qdi/o4g/p3d`, FakeAuthToken
  `wpm→n2l`, FakeUserAccount `rpm→h2l`. **Device-confirmed: login bypass works on the GHL Normal variant.**
- **Offline component picker + Prefix API path** (commit **`016abf5`**): device report — DXVK/VKD3D/Box64/
  FEXCore/GPU-driver picker lists empty. Offline picker `gof Lgof;→Li6e;` (`a(Li6e;,ComponentType,I,Lkq3;,I)`
  page=200 dispatcher; `c(Lkq3;)` `.locals 11`; ComponentType stays unobfuscated). Prefix chokepoint
  `Lcpb;->b(Ln7a;,String)`→`Lzua;->a(Lgn9;,String)` (method `b`→`a`, 38 call sites; found via const
  `simulator/v2/getComponentList` in `i6e`).

**Remaining root failures to refingerprint** (after fp3): Per-game menu id capture (shared) [unblocks 6 menu-row
cascades], privacy cluster (Disable Firebase Crashlytics / Mob Push / heartbeat / OTA / Stub analytics), GPU
spoof DXVK plumbing, PC-accurate vibration, Local game-id assignment, Show PC Game Settings row, Explore tab
hijack, Debug logging, GOG library card (collection-empty), Mute UI sounds (`.wav`→`.m4a` asset retarget).
Full anchor notes in memory `project_bannerhub_v6_607_port`. Artifact-only dry runs until the patch set is green.

### Device-test variant (2026-06-06)

User device-tests the 6.0.7 port on the **GHL Normal** variant (GameHub Lite, `gamehub.lite` pkg, "Normal"
build — no alt-package rebrand). All apply-only menu-row results above (capture / Vibration / GPU Spoof /
Renderer / Show Game ID / Banner Tools) await on-device render confirmation on this variant. Pull the
GHL-Normal APK from the dry-run artifacts (or cut a labeled pre-build) for install + logcat.

### Banner Tools menu row (2026-06-06) — ✅✅ DEVICE-CONFIRMED on GHL Normal (fp8, commit `00926a2`)

**RESOLVED + DEVICE-CONFIRMED.** `"Banner Tools menu row" succeeded` on fp8 ([run 27071031101](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27071031101)) — **36 applied / 13 failed**, up from fp7's 35/14. This was the last menu-row cascade; **all 5** now apply (capture + Vibration/GPU Spoof/Renderer/Show Game ID/Banner Tools).

**On-device (GHL Normal, 2 screenshots 2026-06-06 15:05–15:06):** (1) the **Banner Tools** row renders at the bottom of the library-tile popup (after native rows Add to Desktop / Remove from Library / Edit Cover / Keys & Layout), with its icon — so **Site 2 (tile popup `Ly7c;->f`) row injection works AND the label resolved to "Banner Tools"** (proves the `Lok8;->c0` resolver hook + `maybeResolveCustomLabel` with base class `shg`). (2) Tapping it opens the **Banner Tools dialog** with all sub-entries (Vibration, GPU Spoof, Renderer, Game ID, Audio, GOG, Overlay [greyed/root-gated], Root, Cancel) — so the click handler `BhBannerToolsMenuRowClick` + per-feature dispatch work. End-to-end confirmed for the tile-popup entry point.

**Site 1 (game-detail More Menu `Lc37;->a`) also DEVICE-CONFIRMED** (3rd screenshot, 15:07, DOOMBLADE): the **Banner Tools** row renders in the More Menu grid alongside Add to Desktop / Remove from Library / Edit Cover / Keys & Layout, label correct. So **2 of 3 entry points verified on GHL Normal** (tile popup + More Menu); only the library-LIST popup (Site 3 `Levb;->b0`) is not yet separately screenshotted. Cosmetic: the row icon is the generic `Lv45;->l` glyph (a circle-X), not a gear — swap to a nicer `Lv45` icon field later if desired (purely visual).

**Final 6.0.7 inject-point map (verified in dex):**
- Site 1 More Menu `Lc37;->a`: list builder `Lx9d`→**`Lj3c`** (kotlin ListBuilder, `Lm4`→AbstractList implements `java.util.List` ✓). Inject after last `Lj3c;->add(Object)Z`; builder register **derived** from the add's instance reg (v3 in 6.0.7, was hardcoded v4). Row ctor `Liae(Lo05,String,Lpw6)`→**`Ltyc(Ln55,String,Lgv6)`**.
- Site 2 tile popup `Ly7c;->f`: `Lqs2;->H([Object)List` asList **GONE** → rows assemble via `filled-new-array {…},[Lg6c;` → **`Llp0;->R([Object)ArrayList`**; inject after that R() move-result (register derivation unchanged). Row `Lscd`→**`Lg6c(String,Ln55,String,Lev6)`**.
- Site 3 list popup `Levb;->b0`: finalize virtual `Lx9d;->i()Lx9d;` **GONE** → static **`Lny2;->C(Ljava/util/List;)Lj3c;`** (builder created via `Lny2;->I()`); inject before the `return-object` after it. Row `Lz4e(Lell,Lnw6,int)`→**`Lstc(Ldwj,Lev6,int)`**.

**Extension `BhBannerToolsMenuRowClick` forName remap (every class/ctor verified in raw dex):** `iae→tyc`, `scd→g6c`, `z4e→stc`, icon `o05→n55`, onClick `pw6→gv6`(Function1, `invoke(Object)`), `nw6→ev6`(Function0, `invoke()`), `ell→dwj`, `tdi→shg`; icon-holder `zz4→v45` (static field `v`→`l`, wrapper `Lxrl→Lu3k`, `getValue()`→Ln55). `Lstc;-><init>(Ldwj;Lev6;I)V` is `synthetic` but reflectable via `getDeclaredConstructor`.

**607 menu-row family now COMPLETE.** Remaining reds are unrelated roots (GPU spoof DXVK plumbing, PC-accurate vibration, privacy cluster, Local game-id, Show PC Game Settings row, Explore tab hijack, Debug logging, GOG library card).

**`Mute UI sounds` — DROPPED from 6.0.7 (2026-06-06).** 6.0.7 ships a native "mute UI sounds" toggle in default settings, and re-encoded the bundled UI sounds `.wav`→`.m4a` (so the `.wav` substitution would never match). Per user, the patch is kept in the tree but its `compatibleWith` is pinned to **6.0.4** (`GAMEHUB_PACKAGE("6.0.4")`, not `GAMEHUB_VERSION`) so the patcher **skips** it on the 6.0.7 build (version-incompatible = skipped, not a SEVERE failure). No longer counted among the remaining failures.

### Privacy cluster (2026-06-06) — ✅ COMPLETE + RUNTIME-VERIFIED (5/5) (fp11, commit `51b7302`, 40/7)

fp9 `8e1e529` (37/9) did Mob + the 2 gates; **fp10 ([run 27071955053](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27071955053), commit `234076f`) = 39 applied / 7 failed** — `"Disable heartbeat"` + `"Stub analytics events"` both **succeeded**, finishing the cluster. Key 6.0.7 discovery: **the app class was renamed `Lcom/xiaoji/egggame/BaseAndroidApp;` → `Lcom/xiaoji/egggame/AndroidApp;`** (relevant to any patch anchored on it).

- ✅ **Disable heartbeat** — re-anchored on the stable URL-path strings (dropped R8 class letters). 6.0.7 write coroutines: `Lk3n;->invokeSuspend` (handles BOTH start + the 30s update tick — one lambda) and `Lg3n;->invokeSuspend` (end), each stubbed to return `Unit.INSTANCE`. **Dropped the getUserPlayTimeList read-stub on 6.0.7**: its success type changed (the error type `Lg50` extends RuntimeException, the success comes back via coroutine continuation), so fabricating an empty success applies but is crash-risky — and that read is user-initiated, not automatic egress, so it's left active. ⚠️ device-check the playtime UI still works.
- ✅ **Stub analytics events** — switched from the 6.0.4 fake-success stub-return (`Lyw5`/`Lxnm` wrappers, not cleanly re-derivable on 6.0.7) to a crash-safe **URL redirect to `http://127.0.0.1`** (same technique as the OTA patch). The `/events` batch reporter `Lzy5;->a(Collection,Lkq3;)` and the `/events/device-performance-config` reporter `Lb34;->invokeSuspend` each env-switch dev2/beta/prod URLs within one method — every analytics-URL const-string (matched on `vgabc.com/events`) is overwritten right after it loads, so all environments redirect. Reporters' own coroutine error paths swallow the connection-refused.

- ✅ **Disable Mob Push tracking** — fixed by the app-class rename. Mob init now lives in `AndroidApp.b()` (`MobSDK.init` + `submitPolicyGrantResult` + `MobPush.addPushReceiverInMain`); structural helper #2 resolves to `Lns8;->D(Landroid/content/Context;)V` (was `Lnt5;->N`). Manifest layer (`com.mob.`/`cn.fly.` prefix disable) unchanged. **Succeeded.**
- 🚫 **Disable Firebase Crashlytics** — MOOT on 6.0.7, gated out (`compatibleWith` → 6.0.4, skipped). No `FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance()`/`setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled` calls remain; `AndroidApp.a()` self-guards (logs "FirebaseCrashlytics component is not present." via `Lk7l;->r`, doesn't throw); Firebase collection defaults false. **Proven safe: the 6.0.7 build already launches on-device with this patch unapplied** (login etc. device-confirmed), so the original launch-crash it fixed no longer occurs.
- 🚫 **Disable OTA updates** — MOOT, gated out. The `https://www.xiaoji.com/firmware/update/x1` phone-home URL (handheld FIRMWARE update) is gone entirely from 6.0.7 (firmware-update feature removed). JieLi-lib cleanup dependency skipped alongside.
  - **Follow-up finding (the real "OTA" on 6.0.7): the new APP self-update check is ALREADY neutralized — no new patch needed.** 6.0.7 added a "Check for Updates" in Settings→About (`app_upgrade` API, `core/domain/upgrade/model/AppUpgrade`, classes cjn/djn/il0/t). It rides the same xiaoji API client that the **Redirect-catalog-API + Prefix-API-/v6 patches** already point at BannerHub's backend — which doesn't serve an upgrade — so the check fails gracefully. **Device-confirmed (GHL Normal screenshot 16:21): "Check for Updates … Check failed".** Net: no phone-home to xiaoji's update server, and no "update to stock GameHub" prompt (protects the mod). Also explains the unidentified `43.x` Tencent connections from the heartbeat test = `gamehub.xiaoji.com` backend traffic (the app still talks to some xiaoji APIs beyond the redirected catalog). Optional cosmetic-only follow-up: force `hasNewVersion=false` so it reads "Already up to date" instead of "Check failed".

**Static verification (fp10 patched `apk-Normal-GHL`, apktool-decompiled 2026-06-06):** every privacy injection confirmed landed in the output APK —
- Analytics: `Lzy5;->a` — all 3 env `/events` URLs each immediately followed by `const-string v13, "http://127.0.0.1"` (same reg v13); `Lb34;->invokeSuspend` — all 3 env device-perf URLs each followed by `const-string v3, "http://127.0.0.1"`.
- Heartbeat: `Lk3n;->invokeSuspend` and `Lg3n;->invokeSuspend` both begin with `sget-object v0, Lkotlin/Unit;->INSTANCE … return-object v0` (original body now dead code).
- Mob: `submitPolicyGrantResult` + `addPushReceiverInMain` = 0 occurrences in `AndroidApp`, `submitPolicyGrantResult` = 0 in `Lns8;`, `MobSDK;->init` kept (1). Manifest: all 8 `com.mob.*` components carry `android:enabled="false"`; 6.0.7 has no `com.mob` `<provider>` (no ContentProvider auto-init to worry about). The `com.mobile.auth.*` (Aliyun) components are correctly untouched (don't match the `com.mob.` prefix).

**LIVE runtime verification (GHL Normal `gamehub.lite` v6.0.7 vc118, fp10 APK md5 `017ebfcf`, via root bridge `getlog`, 2026-06-06 15:58):**
- ✅✅ **Stub analytics PROVEN at runtime.** On app launch, XiaoJi's `EventsReporter` batched 3 events (`app_launch` ×2 + `user_game_event` carrying `device_id=70f87445…`, `game_id=63362`, `user_id=99999`) and tried to POST them — the log shows `okhttp3 … java.net.ConnectException: Failed to connect to /127.0.0.1:80 … ECONNREFUSED`. The exact telemetry payload (device fingerprint + game id) was BLOCKED at the loopback redirect. **Zero `vgabc.com` egress** in the full log; the only external connections from `gamehub.lite` were to Cloudflare (BannerHub catalog API).
- ✅ **Disable Mob Push** — no `MobSDK`/`MobPush` init or push activity in logs.
- ✅ **App stable** — no FATAL/ANR; app running normally (Bypass-login synthetic `userId=99999` in effect).
- ✅ **Crashlytics — RESOLVED (rewritten as manifest enforcement, fp11 commit `51b7302`, 40/7).** The live log showed Firebase auto-initialises Crashlytics 20.0.3 via its ContentProvider regardless of app code, so the old bytecode strip / gated-moot were both wrong. But checking the 6.0.7 stock manifest: it **already** sets `firebase_crashlytics_collection_enabled=false`, `firebase_analytics_collection_enabled=false`, `firebase_data_collection_default_enabled=false`, and the app never calls `setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled(true)` (0 occurrences) — so Crashlytics inits but **collects/uploads nothing** (matches the zero upload endpoints seen on-device). The patch is now a `resourcePatch` that ENFORCES `firebase_crashlytics_collection_enabled` + `firebase_data_collection_default_enabled = false` (update-in-place or add) — active + version-agnostic, future-proof against an upstream flip. `compatibleWith` back to GAMEHUB_VERSION; **`"Disable Firebase Crashlytics" succeeded`** on fp11.
- ✅✅ **Disable heartbeat PROVEN at runtime (16:08).** A real game was launched + played >40s (logs: `WinEmuModule` ×388, `WineActivity`, `startGame` ×11) — during the whole session there were **0 `heartbeat/game/*` attempts** (the stub returns `Unit` before any request is built), **0 `vgabc.com` egress**, analytics still redirected to 127.0.0.1, and **no crash**. Detached root-side captures (`/sdcard/bh_heartbeat_test.log` 11.5MB logcat + `/sdcard/bh_heartbeat_net.log` ss-loop) survived the focus switch. Net log: `gamehub.lite` did hit Cloudflare (BannerHub API) + GitHub Pages (catalog/explore JSON) + Google (Firebase) + two port-80 Tencent IPs (`43.137.87.65`, `43.145.17.237`, no PTR) — the latter are unidentified content/CDN/game traffic, NOT any patched telemetry endpoint (no telemetry hostname in logs). **Whole privacy cluster now runtime-verified** (analytics + heartbeat blocked, Mob inactive, OTA gone) except the Crashlytics gap below.

**Full host inventory — TLS SNI + HTTP Host capture (tcpdump via bridge, GHL Normal, 16:27–16:30):** definitive negative — **ZERO telemetry hostnames anywhere in the pcap** (no `vgabc`, `statistic-gamehub-api`, `mobpush`, `heartbeat`, `umeng`, `gdt`, `talkingdata`). `gamehub.lite`'s peers: Cloudflare (`2606:4700…`, 81 conns = BannerHub catalog API / GitHub Pages, ours) + Tencent (`43.145.17.237`/`43.137.87.65`/`2402:4e00…` = xiaoji's `gamehub.xiaoji.com` FUNCTIONAL backend; SNI is TLS-1.3-encrypted so not name-readable, but logcat already proved analytics→loopback + heartbeat=0, so it's normal API not telemetry). The `*.unityads.unity3d.com` / `*.unity3d.com` hosts seen in the capture are NOT GameHub — different infra (not the Tencent IPs) = a Unity-based GAME phoning its own Unity Ads/Analytics from inside Wine (game traffic, out of scope). Conclusion: the patched telemetry surface (analytics/heartbeat/Mob) is provably absent from the wire; residual egress is BannerHub (ours) + xiaoji functional API + game-side traffic.

NOTE: this Claude session runs in Termux on the SAME device under test — switching focus to GameHub can background/kill the session, so live-test captures run DETACHED on the root side (to /sdcard) and progress is committed before each record/test run.

### Ported 2 Lite-variant privacy/strip patches → 607 (2026-06-06, fp12 commit `590584f`, 42/7)

Audited the 5 Lite-variant strip patches for 6.0.7 relevance: xiaoji's own 141MB→76MB shrink already did **Strip duplicate font** (dead `core/font/misans_vf.ttf` GONE) and **Strip AVIF/HEIC codecs** (libheif/libaom/libdav1d/libcoder GONE) → those 2 are now MOOT on 6.0.7. The other 3 targets are still present, so ported the 2 worth having on the full build:
- ✅ **Disable Aliyun NumberAuth** (privacy) — neutralises Alibaba/Aliyun carrier one-tap phone-login SDK (`com.mobile.auth.gatewayauth.*`, the components the Mob patch correctly left alone; collects phone#/carrier/device fingerprint). 6.0.7 still ships `libpns-2.14.17-…alijtca_plus.so` + the SDK; loadLibrary site moved class `k7e`→`dwc` but the patch anchors STRUCTURALLY (`"pns-"` const-string + `System.loadLibrary`) so no refingerprint. Stub-then-strip. Dead weight under the login bypass. **fp12: succeeded.**
- ✅ **Strip cloud gaming** (size + partial privacy) — removes the Haima HMCP stack (~21.5MB: 4 Haima WebRTC/IJK libs + `features.cloud` Compose assets [33 files], all present in 6.0.7) and the Haima CN SDK. Anchors on stable vendor class names (`tv.haima.ijk…IjkMediaPlayer.loadLibrariesOnce`, `org.hmwebrtc.NativeLibrary$DefaultLoader.load`) — both verified present. Stub-then-strip. Non-functional under the catalog redirect. **fp12: succeeded.**

Both were `use = false` (opt-in) on `feature/lite-variant-tier1`; flipped to `use = true` for the full 607 privacy build. (`StripAdIdPermissions` was already on 607 + applying.)

**✅ DEVICE-VERIFIED on a FRESH install (GHL Normal, fp12 APK md5-pushed to /sdcard, 2026-06-06).** Fresh (uninstall→install) was required because `extractNativeLibs="true"` + fp10/fp12 share versionCode 118 — an update install would leave stale extracted `libpns`/Haima `.so` and mask the strip. Static: the patched APK has `libpns-*alijtca_plus.so` ABSENT, all 4 Haima libs ABSENT, all 33 `features.cloud` assets ABSENT. First-launch logcat: **0 UnsatisfiedLinkError** (libpns/haima/ijk/hmwebrtc) — the stub-then-strip discipline holds, no missing-lib crash; **0 FATAL/crash**; login bypass intact (`userId=99999`); **0 mobile.auth/pns activity** (Aliyun phone-auth neutralized); analytics redirect still firing (127.0.0.1, no regression). Both ported patches confirmed working end-to-end.

**DECISION — no separate 6.0.7 "Lite" variant needed (the full build absorbed it).** Actual sizes: 6.0.4 base 134.7 MB; 6.0.4 BannerHub Lite ~78 MB; 6.0.7 base 72.5 MB; **our 6.0.7 build (full + NumberAuth + cloud-gaming strips) = 46.3 MB** — i.e. ~40% SMALLER than the old 6.0.4 Lite, with the same-or-better privacy set. The Lite concept was "strip dead weight" (font + NumberAuth + cloud + codecs); on 6.0.7 the font+codec targets are gone (xiaoji's shrink) and NumberAuth+cloud are now in the FULL build, so a "607 Lite" would strip nothing extra → byte-identical to full = pure duplication. The Lite rows can be dropped from the 607 release matrix. (Only revisit if "Lite" is ever redefined as FEATURE removal, e.g. dropping Steam/Epic — explicitly out of scope for the original Lite.)

**Remaining reds after fp12 (7) — none are privacy:** GPU spoof DXVK plumbing, PC-accurate vibration, Local game-id assignment, Show PC Game Settings row, Explore tab hijack, GOG library card (permanent), Debug logging.

**Effort triage + recommended order (2026-06-06):** GPU spoof DXVK plumbing = 2 fingerprints, no native → 🟢 lightest; GOG library card = 2 fp, no native but a logic bug ("collection empty") not just refingerprint; Local game-id = 3 fp; Show PC Game Settings row = 2 fp + resource; Explore tab hijack = Compose-nav seam (medium-high); Debug logging = 5 fp (heavier than it sounds); **PC-accurate vibration = 5 fp + native `winebus.so` runtime binary patcher = 🔴 HEAVIEST** (NOT the best start despite highest value). **Recommended sequence: GPU spoof DXVK plumbing FIRST** (lightest, felt feature, menu row already device-confirmed so finishing the behavior completes it end-to-end, validates the 607 feature-patch refingerprint approach) → Local game-id / Show PC Game Settings → save PC-accurate vibration + Explore hijack for last.

### Local game-id assignment (2026-06-06) — ✅ FIXED (fp16, commit `518726a`, 42/3)

Single-anchor refingerprint, the cleanest kind. The patch hooks GameHub's `Application.onCreate` to fire the `LocalGameIdAssignment.scanAndAssign(Context)` library-DB scanner, and it anchored `firstMethod` on `Lcom/xiaoji/egggame/BaseAndroidApp;` → 0 matches on 6.0.7 → `SEVERE` at `LocalGameIdAssignmentPatch.kt:79` (fp15 [run 27077010481](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27077010481)). Root cause is the **same `BaseAndroidApp`→`AndroidApp` class rename** caught during the privacy cluster (fp9). Verified against `~/gh607-apktool-d`: `AndroidApp.onCreate()V` exists (`smali_classes3/com/xiaoji/egggame/AndroidApp.smali:779`) with `.locals 54` (→ p0 = v54, so the `move-object/from16 v0, p0` high-reg dance stays correct); `db_game_library.db` + the `server_game_id` column both still present (runtime DB assumptions hold); extension target `scanAndAssign(Context)` unchanged. Retargeted the predicate to `AndroidApp` + refreshed the doc comments. **fp16 ([run 27077235197](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27077235197)) = 42 applied / 3 failed — `"Local game-id assignment" succeeded`.** (Note: applied count holds at 42 not 43 because fp15 dropped GPU-spoof + native GOG-library-card patches entirely.) ⚠️ device-verify the synthetic-id assignment on a real PC-imported library (apply was the only thing proven here).

**Remaining reds after fp16 (3):** Debug logging (5 fp), PC-accurate vibration (5 fp + native `winebus.so` binary patcher 🔴), Show PC Game Settings row (2 fp + resource).

### Show PC Game Settings row (2026-06-06) — ✅ FIXED (fp17, commit `2b7f6f0`, 43/2)

Expected a 2-fingerprint refingerprint; found the More Menu was **fully Compose-rewritten** on 6.0.7 (the method is now a Composable: `Lc37;->a(Lf17;ILev6;Ljh7;Leh3;I)V`, Composer + `$changed` trailer), so the 6.0.4 anchors (static label singleton `Lmil;->U:Lxrl;` + adjacent if-eqz gate) needed re-derivation rather than a name swap. But the underlying **mechanism survived** — the PC-settings block is still guarded by a single boolean `if-eqz` and is the always-present branch, so removing the gate still force-shows the row. Full map: menu `Lx57;->a(Lf37;Lpo7;Lv83;I)V`→`Lc37;->a(Lf17;ILev6;Ljh7;Leh3;I)V` (signature **globally unique**, 1 match in apk); row item ctor `Liae(Lo05,String,Lpw6)`→`Ltyc(Ln55,String,Lgv6)` (×13 in c37, 0 in any sig-sharer); label wrapper `Lxrl;`→`Lu3k;`; PC-settings label `Lmil;->U`→`Llsj;->c0` — re-derived via the Compose resource chain (`features_game_pc_settings` Compose string key → `kqj` resource lambda `:pswitch_8` → packed-switch index **0x14** → `<clinit>` does `const 0x14`/`new Lkqj`/`sput Llsj;->c0:Lu3k;`). In `c37;->a` the label sgets at line 2074; the gate is `if-eqz v63, :cond_55` 6 instructions before it (well within MAX_BACKWARD_SCAN=40). Dropped the now-redundant remove-from-library label disambiguator (signature uniqueness + the Ltyc-ctor anchor already pin the method). Rewrote the patch + its full re-derivation recipe in the header comment. **fp17 ([run 27077560817](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27077560817)) = 43 applied / 2 failed — `"Show PC Game Settings row" succeeded`.** ⚠️ device-verify: open a Steam-linked / retro game's More Menu and confirm "PC Game Settings" now appears (apply was the only thing proven here; also watch for a Compose group-balance crash, though forcing the always-present branch is the safe case).

**Remaining reds after fp17 (2):** Debug logging (5 fp), PC-accurate vibration (5 fp + native `winebus.so` binary patcher 🔴 heaviest).

### Debug logging (2026-06-06) — ✅ PORTED (fp18, commit `eebd455`, 44/1)

Dev-only diagnostic patch (marks APK `android:debuggable=true` + injects `DebugTrace` probes — logcat tag `GH600-DEBUG` @ `Log.i` + `gh600-debug.log` on external storage — along the PC/GOG game-import → library-write path). Was `use=true` and shipped in every 604 build incl. **v1.8.0-604** (verified in that release's run 26702381474: `"Debug logging" succeeded`), i.e. the 604 stable APKs are debuggable. User chose to port it (not gate/opt-out). Re-derived 4 anchors from `~/gh607-apktool-d`:
- **Probe 1 (error-reporter impl):** `Lj86;->e` → `Lz86;->a` — the `Lt9c;` decorator impl whose `a(Ljava/lang/Throwable;Lev6;)V` re-invokes `Lt9c;->a` on a wrapped field then writes to the sink (the other impl `qua` builds a `Pua` → `Lfoa;->v`, not it). Throwable = p1.
- **Probe 2 (import save fn):** `Lvu7;->v` → `Lam7;->v` (SAVE_REPO = BypassLogin's `GAME_LIB_REPO` `Lam7;`; method still `v(GameInfo,LaunchMethod,Continuation)` — model params STABLE so anchored structurally). Catch call `Lxgd;->e` → **`Lt9c;->a(Throwable,Lev6;)`** (interface method renamed `e`→`a`, Function0 `Lmw6;`→`Lev6;`); Throwable in p3 at the call site (am7.smali:7212). Entry + catch probes both land.
- **Probe 3 (retro upsert marker): DROPPED.** `RetroGameDao.upsert` removed on 6.0.7 — retro persistence rebuilt under `com.xiaoji.egggame.retro_emulators.data.local` with Room-generated `RetroGameDao_Impl.a/b/f/g/h` (no `upsert` anywhere in the apk). No equivalent target; the other 3 probes still cover the import path.
- **Probe 4 (import txn):** `Lws7;->invokeSuspend` → **`Lza;->w`** — R8 merged the import lambdas into one dispatch class `Lza;` (constructed inside `Lam7;->v` w/ discriminator 0x17) and outlined the txn body into method `w` (sole method in `Lza;` with both `GameLaunchMethodDao.insert` + `GameLibraryBaseDao.insert`, both anchored on STABLE DAO names).

**fp18 ([run 27077860836](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27077860836)) = 44 applied / 1 failed — `"Debug logging" succeeded`.** ⚠️ runtime-verify the probes actually fire (logcat `GH600-DEBUG` + `gh600-debug.log`) on a real PC/GOG import, and note the 607 release is now debuggable too (revisit if that's unwanted for stable).

**Remaining reds after fp18 (1):** PC-accurate vibration (5 fp + native `winebus.so` binary patcher 🔴 heaviest) — the last one.

### PC-accurate vibration (2026-06-06) — ✅ PORTED (fp19, commit `db7abe1`, **45/0 — ALL GREEN**)

The "heaviest" red turned out to be 4 bytecode hooks (the winebus.so patcher is RUNTIME, in the `BhVibrationController` extension via Hook 4 — not a patch-time native patcher). Traced the whole 6.0.7 rumble path from the one stable anchor: `GamepadServerManager.onRumble(III)V` (still `@Keep`) → `Lfc8;->G(III)V` (device-manager fan-out) → per-device `Lpz7;` (abstract base, fields a:I/b:I = low/high cache, abstract h(II)V + g()V). In `Lfc8;->G`: non-zero (low,high) → `Lpz7;->h(II)V`; (0,0) → `Lpz7;->g()V`.
- **Hook 1 (dispatcher):** `GamepadServerManager.onRumble` — STABLE, unchanged (own `:bh_rumble_fallthrough` label, so the `:cond_4`→`:cond_0` shift is irrelevant).
- **Hook 2 (per-controller):** `Lab8;->g(II)V` → **`Lnz7;->h(II)V`**. `Lnz7` = the concrete multi-motor Physical subclass of `Lpz7` (h(II)V `.locals 3` `const v0,0xffff`; the sibling `oz7` is the single `android.os.Vibrator` device — matched by content). **Device-id field `f:I` confirmed = `getAndroidDeviceId()`** (the `GamePad$Companion` ctor wires `getAndroidDeviceId()→p4→f`; `b()I` returns the OTHER int `c`, the winemu index — so `f`, not `c`, is right).
- **Hook 3 (stop):** `Lab8;->f()V` → **`Lnz7;->g()V`** (multi-motor stop, `.locals 1`).
- **Hook 4 (winebus disk-patch trigger):** RETARGETED. The dedicated env-vars builder (`Lbg5;->a(...)V .locals 35`) was dissolved on 6.0.7 — the LD_PRELOAD env is now assembled inside a merged WineActivity class (`bqn;->t0`) with no clean Context field. Moved the `ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce(ctx)` call to **`WineActivity.onCreate(Bundle)`** (stable non-obfuscated `AppCompatActivity` = a Context, runs at game launch before the Wine process maps winebus.so; the AtomicBoolean gate makes an at-onCreate call self-deduplicating). onCreate is `.locals 19` so p0 is high-reg → `move-object/from16 v0, p0`. A strictly more robust anchor than the obfuscated env builder.

**fp19 ([run 27078091158](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27078091158)) = 45 applied / 0 failed.** 🎯 **ALL BannerHub v6 patches now apply on GameHub 6.0.7 (vc118).** ⚠️ device-verify rumble end-to-end (sustained hold via the winebus patch, dual-motor dispatch, instant release) — especially that imagefs ships winebus.so on 6.0.7 and the disk-patch finds + rewrites it from `WineActivity.onCreate`.

### 🐞 GOG download crash on 6.0.7 — FIXED (fp20, commit `a081e42`) — found during device-verify

Device-verify pass (fp19 Normal-GHL on `gamehub.lite` via `getlog` root bridge) caught a real crash (NOT a fingerprint issue) when downloading a GOG game: `SecurityException: Starting FGS with type dataSync … targetSDK=36 requires [FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC]` at `BhDownloadService.onStartCommand:249` → `Force finishing GogGamesActivity`, process SIGKILL. Root cause: our `BhDownloadService` runs as a `dataSync` foreground service; the **6.0.4 base manifest declared `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC`** (service rode on it) but **6.0.7 dropped it** — base now only has `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` (GameHub moved its own FGS dataSync→specialUse, the `PcEmulatorAutoUnzipService` swap noted in the master map). Fix: `GogManifestPatch` now declares `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC` itself (idempotent — no-op on bases that already have it). **fp20 ([run 27078466807](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27078466807)) green, `aapt` confirms the perm is in the patched manifest.** ⚠️ device-retest the GOG download.

**Device-verify results (fp19/fp20 on `gamehub.lite`, via getlog root bridge):**
- ✅ app launch clean (no crash).
- ✅ **Explore tab hijack** — `BannerExploreActivity` Displayed +45ms, focused/visible.
- ✅ **Show PC Game Settings row** — visible on a Steam game AND a local-imported game, no Compose group-balance crash.
- ✅ **Debug logging** logcat channel live (tag `GH600-DEBUG`). ⚠️ the file backup channel is broken — hardcoded `com.xiaoji.egggame` path → ENOENT/EACCES on the `gamehub.lite` variant; pre-existing extension limitation, not a 607 regression (FIX-LATER: derive the path from the runtime package).
- ✅ **GOG download + add to library** (fp20) — Gun Slugs downloaded, added, and shows in library after restart (the §40/§41 restart-to-show behavior holds on 6.0.7).
- ✅ **Local game-id assignment** — LOGGED PROOF: after adding the GOG game (lands with sentinel `server_game_id=0`) and restarting, fresh proc 27880 logged `BhLocalGameId: assigned synthetic server_game_id to 1 row(s)` (700ms after start, on the daemon thread). Full chain confirmed.
- ✅ bonus **Bypass login** — FakeAuthToken/FakeUserAccount synthetic userId 99999.
- ✅ **PC-accurate vibration** — in-game with a controller: rumble works and **SUSTAINS** (no ~1s cutoff). Sustain is the definitive proof — it's impossible without the winebus.so disk-patch firing (SDL2 `rumble_expiration` would otherwise cut it), so it confirms (a) Hook 4's retarget to `WineActivity.onCreate` fired, (b) winebus.so exists in the 607 imagefs and got rewritten on disk, (c) `BhVibrationController` active in logcat (`mode=1 intensity=100`), no crash.
- ⏳ **Debug import probes** — optional; won't fire on a GOG install (they hook the PC-emulator save path `am7.v`/`za.w`, not the GOG library-write path). Needs a PC game import. The patch is already proven live via the logcat channel.

## 🏁🏁 6.0.7 PORT — DEVICE-VERIFIED COMPLETE (2026-06-06)

All 45 patches apply (fp19) AND the full feature set is device-verified on `gamehub.lite` v6.0.7 vc118 (fp19/fp20, via getlog root bridge): Explore hijack, Show PC Game Settings row, Local game-id (logged), Debug logging (logcat), GOG download+library (after the fp20 FGS fix), Bypass login, and PC-accurate vibration (sustained rumble). 1 device-found bug (GOG FGS crash) found AND fixed in the same pass. Remaining before a stable cut are NON-patch chores:
1. ✅ **`release.yml` 604→607 cleanup DONE** (commit `141b680`): base 6.0.4→6.0.7 / vc114→vc118, all `gamehub-604-build` blob/tree URLs→607, `-604`→`-607` suffix, version-string examples→607, `6.0.4's`→`6.0.x's` Vulkan X-server, dropped the stale `:wine`-boundary clause. **Lite fully removed from 607 notes** (per user: Lite builds will no longer be made/required on 607 — the matrix already produces 9 APKs, no Lite job): variants table de-Lited (9 rows, single APK col), 18→9 APK count, dropped Optional-Lite + Mute-UI-sounds bullets/rows (Mute UI sounds is gated out on 607), Lite-strips row reframed to "Privacy/size strips (every variant)", What's-new reframed to the 6.0.7 base bump.
2. **Debuggable-on-stable decision** (Debug logging marks 607 debuggable, carried from 604).

### Versioning for the first 607 stable = `1.0.0-607` (build-number scheme reworked, 2026-06-06)

User wants the 607 line to reset to **`1.0.0-607`**. Problem: the Explore update banner is a strict `latest > installed` int compare on the stamped build number, and the OLD `stamp_version.py` formula (`major*1e6+minor*1e3+patch`, suffix ignored) gave `1.0.0-607` → `1,000,000` < `1.8.0-604` → `1,008,000`, so existing 604 users would get NO in-app update prompt. Fix (commit `763a658`): fold the GameHub base ABOVE the semver — `version_to_build = base*1_000_000 + major*10_000 + minor*100 + patch`. Now `1.0.0-607`→`607,010,000` > `1.8.0-604`(new `604,010,800` / old-baked `1,008,000`), monotonic within the 607 line, and max realistic `9.9.9-999`=`999,090,909` stays under the signed-int32 ceiling (the build is read as Java `optInt`; `base*1e8` would have overflowed — deliberately avoided). Updated the `BhExploreManifest` doc comment to match. **CI-verified** ([run 27079094758](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27079094758), dispatch `version=1.0.0-607-pre1`): `[stampver] … build=607010000`. To cut the stable: dispatch `release.yml` with `version=1.0.0-607` + `stable` ticked.
3. Minor: the Debug-logging file-backup path is hardcoded `com.xiaoji.egggame` (logcat channel works; file backup EACCES on renamed variants) — FIX-LATER, derive path from runtime package.
4. Optional: exercise the Debug import probes with a PC (not GOG) game import.

### 🐞 Legacy renderer (GLES2) device-found BROKEN on 6.0.7 → GATED OUT (fp21, commit `95071e2`)

Device-verify probe (user-driven, DOOMBLADE on `gamehub.lite`): selecting **Legacy** renderer → **instant hard crash**. Crash buffer: `F libc: Fatal signal 6 (SIGABRT) … gamehub.lite` / `JNI DETECTED ERROR: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: no … method "Lcom/winemu/core/server/XServer;.setSurfaceFormat(I)V" at XServer.<clinit>` from `libxserver_legacy.so (JNI_OnLoad+128)`. Root cause: the swap loads the bundled **6.0.2** `libxserver_legacy.so`, whose `JNI_OnLoad` RegisterNatives needs Java XServer methods **6.0.7 deleted** (`setSurfaceFormat`, `setFlipEnabled`) → NoSuchMethodError mid-registration → ART aborts the process. Decompile confirms: 6.0.7 XServer has **no `setFlipEnabled`** and grew **11→40 natives** (ReShade FX engine + `setGpuPassthroughEnabled`), so the 6.0.2 lib can't satisfy the contract in EITHER direction (missing old methods + can't provide new ones). Worked on 6.0.4 because there the gap was a single renamed method (`setRenderingEnabled`→`setFlipEnabled`, "10/11 matched") that `addNativeMethod` bridged; 6.0.7 is a full rewrite — not patchable without a source-built GLES2 libxserver matching the 40-native contract. **Confirmed live DOOMBLADE was on STOCK libs** (`/proc/<pid>/maps` showed `libxserver.so`/`libwinemu.so`, not `_legacy`) — i.e. New mode works, Legacy crashes.

**Fix:** gated all 4 renderer patches (swap / lib bundle / settings activity / menu row) `compatibleWith → 6.0.4` (same skip mechanism as Mute UI sounds), dropped the GAMEHUB_VERSION import, and removed Legacy-renderer + the already-gated GPU-Spoof rows from the release notes. **fp21 ([run 27079640665](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27079640665)) = 41 applied / 0 failed** — the 4 renderer patches show `WARNING: incompatible with 6.0.7 but compatible with 6.0.4` (skipped, not SEVERE). Side effect: APK 48.5→**47.0 MB** (the bundled legacy `.so` pair no longer packed). The "Renderer" per-game row is gone → users can't select the crashing mode; games always use the stock Vulkan X-server. Revive only with a 6.0.7-contract GLES2 libxserver (comment in each patch documents this).

## 6.0.7 port — patch-apply phase COMPLETE (2026-06-06)

All 45 patches green (fp19). Outstanding before a stable 6.0.7 cut:
1. **Device-verifies owed** (apply-proven, not yet runtime-confirmed): Local game-id (fp16), Show PC Game Settings row (fp17), Debug logging probes fire (fp18), PC-accurate vibration rumble (fp19), Explore tab hijack (refingerprinted earlier).
2. **`release.yml` 604→607 string cleanup** (~15 refs: release-notes body, `-604` version suffix, vc114, branch URLs, What's-new bullets) — flagged since branch setup.
3. **Debuggable-on-stable decision** — Debug logging marks 607 releases `android:debuggable=true` (carried over from 604); revisit if unwanted for a shipped privacy build.

### Banner Tools menu row (2026-06-06) — STARTED (5th cascade; the hard one)

After fp7, `"Banner Tools menu row"` is the only remaining menu-row cascade still red. Unlike the capture
patch (head-only `captureGameId` injection) this patch does **register-level row injection** at all 3 sites
AND its Java extension (`BhBannerToolsMenuRowClick`, 497 lines) reflectively **constructs** GameHub's row
objects — so both the patcher fingerprints/inject-points AND the extension's hardcoded class/field names need
the 6.0.7 remap, and the 6.0.7 row-assembly mechanism itself changed at 2 of 3 sites.

**Scope (from the decompile work already done for the capture patch):**
- **Site 1 — More Menu** `Lx57;->a`→`Lc37;->a(Lf17;ILev6;Ljh7;Leh3;I)V`. Patch finds the LAST
  `Lx9d;->add(Object)Z` and injects `appendBannerToolsRowTo(v4)` after it. TODO: confirm `Lc37;->a` still
  collects rows via an `Lx9d`-style `add()` list builder (and in which register — `v4` is hardcoded), or
  re-derive. Row ctor `Liae(Lo05,String,Lpw6)`→`Ltyc(Ln55,String,Lgv6)`.
- **Site 2 — tile popup** `Lted;->f`→`Ly7c;->f(Lz7c;Lgv6;Lev6;ZLfyc;Leh3;I)V`. Patch keys off
  `Lqs2;->H([Object)List` (asList) + its `move-result` register → **GONE in 6.0.7** (y7c.f has NO
  List-returning invoke; rows = 5× `Lg6c;-><init>(String,Ln55,String,Lev6)` added some other way). Must
  find the new row-collection point + register. Row class `Lscd`→`Lg6c`.
- **Site 3 — list popup** `Lpzc;->j0`→`Levb;->b0(Loza;…11)List`. Patch keys off `Lx9d;->i()Lx9d;` finalize
  + trailing `return-object` → **no 6.0.7 equivalent** (`Lx9d;->i()` gone). Must find the new finalize/return
  shape. Row class `Lz4e(Lell,Lnw6,int)`→? ; label base `tdi`→`shg`, StringResource `Lell`→`Ldwj`.
- **Java extension `BhBannerToolsMenuRowClick`** `Class.forName` remap: `iae→tyc`, `o05→n55`, `pw6→gv6`,
  `zz4`(icon holder, field `v`)→?, `scd→g6c`, `nw6→ev6`, `z4e`(list-popup row)→?, `ell→dwj`, `tdi→shg`.
  Constructor SIGNATURES changed (e.g. `Lscd(String,Lo05,String,Lnw6)`→`Lg6c(String,Ln55,String,Lev6)` —
  verify arg order/types per site). Label still Unsafe-allocated then field `a`(key)+`b`(items) set on base `shg`.

Multi-iteration like the original VibrationMenuRowPatch build. Artifact-only dry runs; same
inner-`returnType`-anchor caveat as the capture site-3 fix applies. — *in progress.*

### fp4 (2026-06-06) — Per-game menu id capture (shared) + Vibration resolver refingerprinted

Commits **`fe7b601`** (refingerprint) → **`923c0d6`** (diag) → **`052fa35`** (site-3 fix) → **`e04384c`** (cleanup)
on `gamehub-607-build`. **✅ RESOLVED at fp6 ([run 27070341532](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27070341532)):** `"Per-game menu id capture (shared)"` + `"PC Vibration Settings menu row"` + `"GPU Spoof menu row"` + `"Renderer menu row"` + `"Show Game ID menu row"` all **succeeded** (fp7 `e04384c` [run 27070444005] = clean re-verify after removing diagnostic instrumentation — **35 applied / 14 failed**, up from fp3's 29/20). Capture root + 4 of its 5 cascades now apply.

**Debug arc (fp4→fp6):** fp4 ([27069897058](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27069897058)) — capture still failed with a generic `Required value was null` (cascaded to all 6 rows). Ruled out dependencies (only dep = trivial `sharedGamehubExtensionPatch` dex-loader; the vibration-label dep succeeded). Verified all 5 method mappings byte-exact + present in the **raw dex of the md5-matched CI apk** + the `firstMethod{parameterTypes==…}` pattern is proven (PrefixApiPath uses it, passes) — a contradiction. Instrumented each `firstMethod` with a labeled exception (commit `923c0d6`); fp5 diag ([27070244591](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/27070244591)) pinpointed **`BH-CAPTURE-SITE3-LISTPOPUP-NOMATCH`** — sites 1+2 matched, site 3 alone returned null.

**🔑 Root cause + reusable lesson:** site 3 was the ONLY predicate with an inner anchor comparing a **referenced** method's return type — `(Lok8;->c0 call).returnType == "Ljava/lang/String;"`. On this patcher that `MethodReference.returnType == "<String literal>"` comparison **silently evaluates false** (CharSequence-vs-String `.equals`), so the whole predicate was unsatisfiable → `firstMethod` null. Method-LEVEL `returnType == "V"` / `"Ljava/util/List;"` (sites 1/2 and the method-level check) is fine; and inner `it.parameterTypes.toList() == listOf(...)` is fine. **Rule: never anchor on a referenced instruction's `returnType`; use definingClass + name (+ params via `.toList()`).** Fix (commit `052fa35`): dropped the redundant `Lok8;->c0` anchor — the 11-param `(L,Z,9×L)→List` signature is globally unique (1 method in the whole apk) so it pins `Levb;->b0` alone.

**Still red after fp6 (NOT part of this task — own passes):** `Banner Tools menu row` (the 5th cascade — carries the SAME 3 site fingerprints PLUS byte-level row-injection logic that 6.0.7 changed: the `Lqs2;->H` asList move-result / `Lscd`→`Lg6c` / `Lz4e` row builders), plus unrelated roots `GPU spoof DXVK plumbing` and `PC-accurate vibration`.

Targeted the highest-leverage root: `menuGameIdCapturePatch` ("Per-game menu id capture (shared)") gates the whole menu-row family (Vibration → GPU Spoof / Renderer / Banner Tools / Show Game ID all `dependsOn` it; the 4 leaf rows also `dependsOn vibrationMenuRowPatch`'s single shared `l1` resolver hook). Re-derived every obfuscated name by pinning each target via **version-stable anchors** (string literals + framework types) in the 6.0.4 smali, then reading the new R8 names off the matched 6.0.7 method.

**6.0.4 → 6.0.7 map (all verified to resolve to exactly one method in `~/gh607-apktool-d`):**

| Site | 6.0.4 | 6.0.7 | How pinned |
|---|---|---|---|
| CMP stringResource resolver | `Lxd3;->l1(Lell;Lv83;I)String` | `Lok8;->c0(Ldwj;Leh3;I)String` | only String-returning `(StringResource,Composer,int)` matching l1's body shape (getClass head, `->v(e,composer)` helper, `new-instance(I)` loader). `Ldwj` = empty StringResource subclass of base `Lshg`; `Leh3` = Composer interface (2125 refs) |
| 1 — More Menu builder | `Lx57;->a(Lf37;Lpo7;Lv83;I)V` | `Lc37;->a(Lf17;ILev6;Ljh7;Leh3;I)V` | `Lf37`=GameDetailArgs found in 607 as `Lf17` via `"GameDetailArgs(gameId="` literal; builder gained params + moved class (Steam restructure killed its old `steamGameUpdateTipsBuildId_`/version strings) but still takes GameDetailArgs p0. Row ctor `Liae(Lo05,String,Lpw6)` → `Ltyc(Ln55,String,Lgv6)` (×12, unique to c37 vs the 2 other sig-sharers su/v90) |
| 2 — Library-tile popup | `Lted;->f(Lued;Lpw6;Lnw6;ZLt9e;Lv83;I)V` | `Ly7c;->f(Lz7c;Lgv6;Lev6;ZLfyc;Leh3;I)V` | `Ly7c` found via the surviving action-key literals `local_detail_menu_settings/_remove/_add_desktop/_edit_cover`. Row ctor `Lscd` → `Lg6c` (×5); 6.0.4 `Lqs2;->H` asList anchor **gone** in 6.0.7 → replaced with `Lg6c;-><init>` count≥4 (unique vs sig-sharers on2/w16 which build 0) |
| 3 — Library-list popup | `Lpzc;->j0(Laub;Z…11)List` | `Levb;->b0(Loza;Z…11)List` | the `(L,Z,9×L)→List` shape is **globally unique** (1 match in whole apk); `Lx9d;->i()` finalize anchor (no 6.0.7 equiv) → resolver-call `Lok8;->c0` anchor (invoked 9× here, was 7× as `l1` in 6.0.4) |
| resource base class (runtime reflect) | `tdi` (field `a`) | `shg` (field `a`) | both `abstract` with `a:String` (key) + `b:Set` (items) — identical layout, field name unchanged |

**Vibration patch** active fingerprints only = the `l1`→`c0` resolver (above) + the disabled-`if(false)` standalone injections (inert, BannerTools owns those sites). **Dropped** the `Ljoc;->invoke()` diagnostic probe entirely — it was a pure `Log.i` (BhMenuRowClick.probeJocInvoke), `joc` is a 6.0.4-specific synthetic with no stable 6.0.7 anchor, so porting it would only add a fragile failure point. Helper left unreferenced.

**Extension change:** `BhMenuRowClick.maybeResolveCustomLabel` reflects the resource key off `Class.forName("tdi")` → `"shg"` (field `a` unchanged). `BhMenuGameId.captureGameId` needs **no** change — it's toString-regex based (`ServerGameId(value=…)` / `gameId=…`), and GameDetailArgs' toString format is unchanged, so it survives the renames for all 3 p0 types.

**Note:** local `:patches:compileKotlin` not possible here — the `app.revanced.patches` Gradle plugin lives in the `revanced/gamehub-patches` GitHub Packages registry the local token can't read; CI is the verification path (as with fp1–fp3). BannerToolsMenuRowPatch (separate cascade member) carries the SAME 3 site fingerprints **plus** byte-level row-injection logic (the `Lqs2;->H` move-result / `Lscd`/`Lz4e` row builders) that 6.0.7 changed — it still needs its own pass next.

## 2026-05-29 — GOG in-session refresh root-caused (§41) + always-available entry-point scoping (profile-row paused)

**Branch:** `feature/gog-explore-tab`. Two threads after pre22.

### §40→§41 — "added GOG game doesn't show in library until restart"
- **pre23 (`73a223e`, run 26634078863):** tried writing the library row on Room's *own* connection (`RoomRefreshHelper.getRoomConnection` BFS for `android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase`) so Room's TEMP invalidation triggers fire. **Device-tested: FAILED, still needs restart.** Row committed correctly (`gog_1709371377` Gunslugs landed) but no in-session refresh.
- **Root cause (decompile-proven, `~/gamehub-6.0.4-nologin/jadx-out`):** GameHub's library DB runs on **androidx.room 2.7+ with the `BundledSQLiteDriver`** — its own statically-linked native SQLite (`libsqliteJni.so`), **no `android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase`, no `SupportSQLiteOpenHelper`** (`lyi.java:283`). Room's triggers + `room_table_modification_log` are connection-local **TEMP** objects (`lyi.java:452-456` `CREATE TEMP TABLE …`; file's `sqlite_master` has zero persisted triggers/log). So **any write from a separate `android.database.sqlite` connection is invisible to Room's tracker** — pre23's BFS found nothing → silently fell back to the foreign-connection write. This also means §37/§39/§40 never could have worked.
- **pre24 (`1bd8b11`, run 26636074923, ✅, installed on `gamehub.lite`) — DECISION = accept restart, honest UX.** `GogLaunchHelper.addToLibrary` reverted to a plain foreign-connection write + toast **"Added "X" — restart GameHub to see it in your library"**. Deleted `RoomRefreshHelper.java` (fully dead under the bundled driver) and the §40/§39 machinery. The "proper" no-restart fix (write through Room's own native `androidx.sqlite` connection) was rejected as too fragile + a coroutine-mutex race risk on the live library DB.

### Always-available GOG entry point — scoping (the Banner Tools tile is post-game only)
User: Banner Tools is reachable only via per-game menus, so a fresh **empty-library** install can't reach GOG. Scoped 4 options against the decompile:
- **Permanent library card** — REJECTED. DAO queries `findByUserId`; our card's fresh-install fallback `user_id=99999` won't match the real user; handheld/explore surface split (§33) unresolved; needs launch-interception. (We already retired the seeded card in pre12 for the surface split.)
- **"Add from GOG" on an add-game menu** — PROBED NEGATIVE. No unified add-game-source menu exists: PC-import is a standalone exe-picker, store accounts bind in the profile, the library land-menu (`khl`) is per-game (Online Update / Add to Desktop / Instant Settings).
- **Launcher icon** — TRIVIAL/always-available. `GogMainActivity` is already `exported=true`; adding a MAIN/LAUNCHER `<intent-filter>` in `GogManifestPatch` puts a "GOG" icon in the Android app drawer (separate icon, not in-GameHub-UI). Not yet built.
- **Native profile-tab row (Steam/Epic-style)** — USER'S CHOICE. The base app even has orphaned GOG scaffolding: `e37` platform enum has `GOG(3)` (but jadx "Fake field" = unreferenced/dead), strings `features_home_profile_gog_{title,bind,desc}` + `…_platform_tab_gog`, icon `common_game_ic_gog_start_type`/`GogIconSelected` vector. No construction site, no `d37` GOG entry, no bind backend.

**Profile-row RE checkpoint (PAUSED here per user "update memory for now"):** Profile screen is fully obfuscated Jetpack Compose. `po7.java` (2731 lines) = profile **ViewModel** (launches `new vl7(…)` steam bind handler at po7:2534; epic via ck5/h4d). No reusable `platformRow(icon,label,onClick)` composable found (`hc5.a(int,Composer,nw6,String,bool)` is a fixed-asset row, not it). **Core blocker:** the ReVanced extension is compiled without the Compose compiler plugin → it can't author @Composable UI; injection must either invoke a GameHub row composable (unconfirmed-reusable) with GOG args in smali, or clone the Epic-row smali block with byte-correct Compose group-key/restart-scope plumbing vs R8'd runtime — large, multi-iteration, high crash risk. **DECISION PENDING:** continue profile-row RE (find the screen composable that calls po7's handlers + emits Steam/Epic rows) vs ship the trivial launcher icon (same end goal).

## 2026-05-29 — GOG enrolled into Banner Tools + 604 merged into gog branch (pre22)

**Branch:** `feature/gog-explore-tab`. Merged `gamehub-604-build` (51 commits: Banner Tools dialog, audio toggle, external-launcher/localgameid, docs) **into** the isolated gog branch so the Banner Tools consolidated dialog exists here — direction preserves the "keep GOG separate" directive (we pull 604 *into* gog; GOG does not leak into 604/Lite). Merge conflicts (2): `BhMenuRowClick.java` resolver — union of all three label mappings (`bh_gog_label`→GOG kept alongside 604's `bh_gameid_label`/`bh_banner_tools_label`); `PROGRESS_LOG.md` — kept both sides' entries.

**GOG enrollment (per banner-tools-enrollment rule, "only inside Banner Tools"):**
- `BhBannerToolsMenuRowClick`: added 6th tile — `TILE_LABELS`+`TILE_DRAWABLES` "GOG"/`bh_bt_gog`, `dispatch()` case 5 → `new com.xj.winemu.gog.BhGogMenuRowClick().invoke(null)` (opens `GogMainActivity`, not a dialog like the others).
- New `bh_bt_gog.xml` (purple GOG-face squircle on the shared dark tile) + registered in `BannerToolsDrawablesPatch` `DRAWABLE_NAMES`.
- `GogMenuRowPatch`: 3 standalone row injections wrapped in `if (false) { @Suppress("UNREACHABLE_CODE") … }` (same idiom as GpuSpoof/Renderer/GameId) — GOG no longer appears as its own per-game row; `dependsOn(vibrationMenuRowPatch)` retained for the shared `Lxd3;->l1` resolver. No change to `BannerToolsMenuRowPatch.dependsOn` (matches the other 4 tiles; GOG classes ride the shared extension, `GogMainActivity` via default-applied `gogManifestPatch`).
- Tile grid refactor: `buildTileRow`→`buildTilesView`, wraps at **5 per row** (greedy, left-aligned; short final row padded with weighted spacers) so the 6th tile doesn't clip 56dp icons on portrait; inter-tile side margin tightened 4dp→2dp. Click wiring now drives off an ordered tile list so which==dispatch case regardless of row grouping.

Next: compile gate → grep SEVERE → pre22 artifact build → device test (per-game menu → Banner Tools → GOG tile → GogMainActivity opens). pre21 (§39 refresh nudge, separate test) still running. Pre-release: artifact-only.

## 2026-05-28 — 🔊 PulseAudio screen-record fix: "Recording-compatible audio" global toggle (MERGED ✅)

**Device-verified:** user installed `apk-Normal` (pkg banner.hub), Banner Tools → Audio → "Recording-compatible", relaunched with PulseAudio → screen recording now captures audio. Confirmed working.

**Branch:** `feature/audio-recording-mode` off `gamehub-604-build`.
**Build:** compile-check green (run 26611029714); release build green (run 26611119950, `1.5.2-604-audio-pre1`, artifact-only). Both patches applied across all 9 variants — `"Recording-compatible audio"` + `"Recording-compatible audio settings activity"` succeeded → the `Lqnh;->c()` const-string fingerprint resolved against GameHub 6.0.4.
**UI:** final settings dialog (`-pre4`, run 26612253314) is a clone of `BhRendererSettingsActivity` — dark rounded card, "Audio"/"All games" header, a Spinner (Low latency / Recording-compatible), Cancel/Save. The first AlertDialog `Switch` rendered invisibly under `Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar`; lesson recorded: these settings activities need explicit colors / native widgets (clone the Renderer dialog).

**Problem (device-diagnosed via root logcat/dumpsys):** With the in-game audio driver set to **PulseAudio**, Android screen recording captures video but **no audio**; **ALSA records fine**. Root cause: banner.hub's pulse sink (`module-aaudio-sink`) opens an AAudio **low-latency** stream → the framework grants it as **MMAP**, which bypasses the AudioFlinger mixer that MediaProjection's `AudioPlaybackCapture` taps → silence. ALSA uses a legacy mixed `AudioTrack` → captured.

- Confirmed live: stream shows `type:AAudio usage=USAGE_MEDIA` in a `MMAP_PLAYBACK` thread, absent from normal mixer tracks. Forcing `setprop aaudio.mmap_policy 1` (NEVER) + `audioserver` restart moved it onto a `MIXER` thread → recording then had sound (user-verified). Global prop reverted afterward.
- **Module RE (objdump):** `module-aaudio-sink` computes `AAudioStreamBuilder_setPerformanceMode(pm + 10)`. So config `pm=0` → `PERFORMANCE_MODE_NONE`(10) → no low-latency request → no MMAP → mixer → **capturable**. Default (no `pm=`) = LOW_LATENCY → MMAP (the bug).

**Fix being built (ReVanced Patcher):**
- **Global on/off toggle** "Recording-compatible audio", default **OFF** (stock low-latency, zero regression for non-recording users). Lives as a **5th tile in the Banner Tools consolidated dialog** (`Vibration·GPU Spoof·Renderer·Game ID·Audio`).
- New extension `com/xj/winemu/audio/` (`BhAudioController` global pref `bh_audio_prefs`/`bh_audio_recording_mode` + `BhAudioSettingsActivity`), cloned from the Renderer feature.
- Functional hook patch on `PulseAudioComponent` (target `com.xiaoji.egggame` 6.0.4): anchor on the `module-aaudio-sink` const-string (R8-proof), rewrite the line via `BhAudioController.configLine(String)` to append **` pm=0`** when the toggle is ON.
- Banner Tools enrollment: 5th tile + `bh_bt_audio` drawable + dispatch case.

**Merged ✅:** `feature/audio-recording-mode` → `gamehub-604-build` (`4bfe029`) → `--no-ff` back-merge → `feature/lite-variant-tier1` (`e68cd38`), both pushed, no conflicts. Post-merge artifact-only builds both green: trunk run 26612540444 (`1.5.2-604-audio`), lite run 26612541277 (`1.5.2-604-audio-lite`). No GitHub Release cut — stays pre-release until "stable".

### Next
Ships in the next BannerHub v6 build. Enroll the toggle into any future Banner-Tools-wide UX changes; nothing else outstanding.

## 2026-05-22 — Docs: fold RetroHRAI into `beacon-setup.md` + README Frontend support

Documentation refresh covering the RetroHRAI integration confirmed earlier today.

**`beacon-setup.md`:**
- Title changed from "Beacon launcher setup" to "External launcher setup" (covers all 4 front-ends; filename kept to preserve incoming links from release notes).
- Top-of-doc status block lists all 4 front-ends with current status (Beacon ✅ / ES-DE ✅ / RetroHRAI ✅ / Daijishou ⚠ untested).
- New **Placeholder syntax by front-end** section explicitly tables Beacon-family (`{file_content}`) vs. Daijishou-family (`{tags.localgameid}`), with the warning that `[localgameid]` is the IN-FILE marker syntax (NOT a command-line placeholder) — captures the 3-iteration debugging lesson permanently.
- New **Shell reference — RetroHRAI / Daijishou** section with all 9 variant blocks using `{tags.localgameid}`; pairs with the existing Beacon/ES-DE blocks.
- Method 1 step 5 and the synthetic-ID paragraph updated to mention both placeholder forms.

**`README.md` `## Frontend support`:**
- Table widened to 3 columns: Frontend / Status / Placeholder.
- RetroHRAI row added with ✅ v1.5.1-604.
- Daijishou row aligned with the RetroHRAI command form (same `{tags.localgameid}` placeholder family).
- Section intro mentions both placeholder families explicitly.

No code/patch/CI changes; docs-only. Will be back-merged into `feature/lite-variant-tier1` via `--no-ff` once landed on `gamehub-604-build`.

### Next

Refresh `feature/lite-variant-tier1` from `gamehub-604-build` to carry the docs forward.

## 2026-05-22 — ✅ RetroHRAI UI round-trip end-to-end device-confirmed on banner.hub v1.5.1-604

Final piece of the RetroHRAI integration: tapping the God of War tile in the RetroHRAI app launches BannerHub V6 + GoW under Wine end-to-end. Captured logcat slice (`/sdcard/Download/retrohrai-gow-launch.log*`):

```
12:04:06.522 D UnifiedEmulatorLauncher: Launching with player=custom.banner.hub.9b884536,
                                        intent=action=banner.hub.LAUNCH_GAME,
                                        component=ComponentInfo{banner.hub/com.xiaoji.egggame.DeepLinkActivity},
                                        ... extras={localGameId=49908, autoStartGame=true}
12:04:06.538 I ActivityTaskManager: START u0 {act=banner.hub.LAUNCH_GAME ... cmp=banner.hub/com.xiaoji.egggame.DeepLinkActivity} ... result code=0
12:04:07.041 I BhExternalLauncher: rewrote banner.hub.LAUNCH_GAME → game_detail id=49908 autoStart=true
12:04:10.915 W GameDetailViewModel: [Android] [Issue#1753] loadGameDetail rendered from local library after server/steam/epic failed. id=49908, sourceId=, sourceType=-1
```

Note `extras={localGameId=49908, ...}` — the INTEGER, not a placeholder string. That's the fix landing.

**Placeholder-syntax saga (resolved for posterity):** Three iterations to find the right token.
1. `{file_content}` — Beacon syntax. Doesn't match RetroHRAI's TAGS_PATTERN. Passed through literally.
2. `[localgameid]` — Daijishou *in-file marker* syntax (used by RetroHRAI's `extractTagId` to find IDs inside the ROM file CONTENT, but NOT a valid command-line placeholder). Doesn't match TAGS_PATTERN. Passed through literally.
3. `{tags.localgameid}` ✅ — matches `UnifiedEmulatorLauncher.TAGS_PATTERN = \{tags\.(\w+)\}`. Substitution flow: RetroHRAI sees `{tags.localgameid}` → opens the ROM file → reads `49908` → `extractTagId` fallback returns raw content → substitutes `{tags.localgameid}` with `49908` → fires intent with the integer.

The two RetroHRAI regexes (`TAGS_PATTERN` for command placeholders vs. `DAIJISHOU_TAG_PATTERN` for in-file markers) have distinct purposes that look superficially similar — captured permanently in the [[project-retrohrai-bannerhub-integration]] memory's regex table to avoid future confusion.

**User-facing doc:** `/storage/emulated/0/Download/retrohrai-bannerhub-commands.txt` rev 2 — all 9 BannerHub variant commands with `{tags.localgameid}` token and the regex distinction documented.

**RetroHRAI DB:** `user_players.amStartArguments` row (`emulatorPackage='banner.hub'`) live-edited via direct SQL through `getlog --write` — no in-app edit needed by the user.

**Front-ends matrix** ([[bannerhub-revanced-external-launcher]]): RetroHRAI moved from 🔄 to ✅ UI-confirmed alongside Beacon and ES-DE.

### Next

- Fold RetroHRAI into `beacon-setup.md` as a documented front-end (4th entry alongside Beacon / ES-DE / Daijishou).
- Update README "Frontend support" badge/list to include RetroHRAI.
- Pending UI test for Daijishou itself (uses same `LAUNCH_GAME` intent contract — expected to work without further changes).

## 2026-05-22 — ✅ External Launcher end-to-end device-confirmed (direct `am start`) on banner.hub v1.5.1-604

First end-to-end success of the External Launcher patch stack on a real PC-imported game (God of War, server_game_id=49908) via direct `am start` from this PRoot session through the logcat-bridge. Confirms the v1.5.1-604 patch shipped pipeline (External Launcher patch + LocalGameIdAssignment + GameDetailViewModel local-fallback) is sound end-to-end.

Logcat proof:
```
11:54:22.597 I ActivityTaskManager: START u0 {act=banner.hub.LAUNCH_GAME ... cmp=banner.hub/com.xiaoji.egggame.DeepLinkActivity (has extras)} ... result code=0
11:54:23.157 I BhExternalLauncher: rewrote banner.hub.LAUNCH_GAME → game_detail id=49908 autoStart=true
11:54:25.588 W GameDetailViewModel: [Android] [Issue#1753] loadGameDetail rendered from local library after server/steam/epic failed. id=49908, sourceId=, sourceType=-1
```

User confirmed Wine session reached background (game launched). The "[Issue#1753] loadGameDetail rendered from local library after server/steam/epic failed" message is the documented fallback path — catalog miss is expected for PC imports; ViewModel correctly resolves from `t_game_library_base` locally and continues to launch.

**Issue diagnosed and fixed along the way:** RetroHRAI uses Daijishou-style `[localgameid]` token, NOT Beacon's `{file_content}`. RetroHRAI's `UnifiedEmulatorLauncher.DAIJISHOU_TAG_PATTERN` (`classes4.dex`) defines the valid set: `[localgameid]` `[steamappid]` `[gog]` `[epicgame]` `[epic]` `[customgame]` `[pcgame]` `[vita_game_id]`. The user's `user_players.amStartArguments` row was rewritten via direct DB UPDATE (force-stop → SQL → push back via `getlog --write` preserving uid:gid:mode) so the next RetroHRAI UI launch will work without any in-app edit.

**Doc deliverable for the user:** all 9 BannerHub variant launch commands saved to `/storage/emulated/0/Download/retrohrai-bannerhub-commands.txt` with `[localgameid]` token + verification recipe.

**Front-ends matrix update** ([[bannerhub-revanced-external-launcher]] memory): RetroHRAI now marked ✅ for direct-am path. UI scan round-trip pending separate confirmation. Once that passes, fold RetroHRAI into `beacon-setup.md` as a documented front-end alongside Beacon / ES-DE / Daijishou.

### Next

User taps RetroHRAI tile → confirm full UI round-trip → fold into `beacon-setup.md` + update README "Frontend support" list to include RetroHRAI.

## 2026-05-22 — PRE-LAUNCH anchor: RetroHRAI → God of War on banner.hub v1.5.1-604

User about to fire the RetroHRAI tile for God of War with the v1.5.1-604 External Launcher contract. Captured here per the new memory-before-launch rule so if the PRoot session is killed by LMK during the launch, the next session can resume from this exact state.

**Test target:** `banner.hub` (Normal variant, v1.5.1-604 patch stack on base 6.0.4, versionCode 114). RetroHRAI v0.4.2 (`com.retrohrai.launcher`). Custom platform "bannerhub" id `bacac28f-6003-46a7-bf55-cbcb471b60cc`, ROM folder `Download/bannerhub/frontend/Beacon`. God of War ROM file = bare 5 bytes `49908`. Matches `db_game_library.db` `t_game_library_base` row `_id=3`, `server_game_id=49908`, source_type=0 (PC-imported, real catalog ID — not synthetic).

**Command staged in RetroHRAI Custom Player (single-line `am start arguments`):**

```
am start -n banner.hub/com.xiaoji.egggame.DeepLinkActivity -a banner.hub.LAUNCH_GAME --es localGameId {file_content} --ez autoStartGame true
```

Expands at scan time to `--es localGameId 49908 --ez autoStartGame true`. Matches the documented [[bannerhub-revanced-external-launcher]] contract (action `banner.hub.LAUNCH_GAME`, extras `localGameId` + `autoStartGame`) — replaces the prior 5.3.5-era VIEW + `app_nav_target=local_game_launch` form stored in `user_players.amStartArguments` until now.

**On-device log capture pre-staged:** `logcat -v threadtime -r 4096 -n 4 -f /sdcard/Download/retrohrai-gow-launch.log` started under `nohup setsid` via the Magisk bridge so it survives a Claude session kill. Post-mortem read = `getlog --exec "tail -n 2000 /sdcard/Download/retrohrai-gow-launch.log"`.

**Full failure-mode + resume-order checklist:** `~/.claude/projects/-home-claude-user/memory/project_retrohrai_gow_test_pending.md`. Includes 5-row failure-mode table (Activity not found / stuck on home / Play prompt instead of auto-launch / loadGameDetail failure / Wine crash post-launch) and the resume sequence for the next session.

No code/patch/CI changes. Pure pre-launch state anchor.

## 2026-05-22 — Note: RetroHRAI front-end test — manual `am start` via logcat-bridge confirmed launches, session-kill hazard

In-progress device test of **RetroHRAI** (github.com/retrohrai/Releases) against `banner.hub` v1.5.1-604. Target game: God of War (PC-imported `.iso` mapping in RetroHRAI). Prior attempt cut off mid-test by the documented LMK session-kill on heavy Wine launches (see `~/NEWTERMUX_MEMORY_AND_PERSISTENCE_2026-05-21.md`).

**Confirmed working manual command** (fired from inside this PRoot session via `getlog --exec`):

```sh
getlog --exec "am start -n banner.hub/com.xiaoji.egggame.DeepLinkActivity \
  -a banner.hub.LAUNCH_GAME \
  --es localGameId <int> \
  --ez autoStartGame true"
```

Game launches end-to-end — the External Launcher patch's intent contract is honored. RetroHRAI itself uses the same `am`-driven contract, so the round-trip via RetroHRAI's library scan is expected to work; full end-to-end confirmation pending.

**Session-kill hazard captured to memory.** Pulling the logcat **immediately** after firing (within 1-2s, before Wine balloons memory) preserves the launch trace in `~/logcat-banner.hub-*.txt` even if the PRoot session is killed by LMK. Added to `[[bannerhub-revanced-external-launcher]]` memory as a permanent operational note.

**No code/patch/CI changes** — manual device-test workflow only. RetroHRAI added to the Front-ends matrix in the external-launcher memory (alongside Beacon ✅ / ES-DE ✅ / Daijishou ⚠).

### Next

User to re-fire RetroHRAI's GoW entry; pull logs immediately. If end-to-end works, fold RetroHRAI into `beacon-setup.md` as a tested front-end alongside Beacon / ES-DE / Daijishou.

## 2026-05-22 — Note: game-id retrieval for front-end launchers is a solved problem

Memory anchor for future sessions resuming on the External Launcher / front-end (Beacon / ES-DE / Daijishou / RetroArch-style) workflow. Verified against current `gamehub-604-build` HEAD on 2026-05-22 — no code changes, docs-only confirmation.

As of **v1.5.1-604** (tag commit `1ca351d`), getting the right `localGameId` integer for any game in the library is fully solved end-to-end:

- **Show Game ID menu row** (merge `090706e`, see entry 2026-05-20) — open any game's details page → tap **Show Game ID** to read the integer `server_game_id` that the front-end's `am launch … --es localGameId <int>` command needs. Also exposes a **View All Games** dialog browser over `db_game_library.db` / `t_game_library_base`.
- **Local game-id assignment** (merge `c270672`, see entry 2026-05-21) — at app startup, rewrites every `server_game_id IN (-1, 0)` row to a stable synthetic 32-bit integer in `[0x40000000, 0x7FFFFFFF]` derived from the row's `local_<UUID>`. Catalog-miss PC imports (`-1`) and Epic/GOG rows (`0`) are now individually addressable.
- Combined effect: **every** library row (PC import / Steam / Epic / GOG) carries a distinct positive integer that the existing 6.0.4 `DeepLinkActivity` dispatch resolves correctly. The earlier "Epic/GOG blocked because Steam-catalog-centric dispatch" framing (DOOMBLADE pre5 era, before localgameid) is **superseded** — the collision was on shared sentinels `0`, not on the dispatch logic.

**Device-confirmed end-to-end** (per local-gameid-assignment entry):
- Beacon (412banner) — `-1` case ("Blur" → synthetic `1,863,762,719` → launches) AND `=0` case (Epic + GOG launch)
- ES-DE (slogik) — same coverage on both sentinel cases
- Daijishou — not yet device-confirmed; same `LAUNCH_GAME` intent contract → expected to work
- RetroArch-style / any frontend that fires the documented `am launch` command — same contract

**Worked example for God of War (PC-imported):** open GoW details → **Show Game ID** → paste the integer into the frontend (Beacon "am start command" field, ES-DE custom systems, Daijishou, RetroArch, etc.) wrapping `--es localGameId <int>`. Full command per variant in `beacon-setup.md` (e.g. for `banner.hub`: `am launch -n banner.hub/com.xiaoji.egggame.DeepLinkActivity -a banner.hub.LAUNCH_GAME --es localGameId <int> --ez autoStartGame true`). For an alt-AnTuTu install the package is `com.antutu.benchmark.full` per `[[feedback_bannerhub_revanced_package]]`.

No release artifact, no APK, no merge — pure documentation/reference checkpoint.

## 2026-05-21 — Docs: link `beacon-setup.md` from v1.5.1-604 release notes + Lite doc

Plumbed the front-end launcher setup guide into the two places it was missing:

- **`v1.5.1-604` release notes.** The Imported/Epic/GOG launch-fix bullet now inlines a link to `beacon-setup.md`, and a new top-level "Front-end launcher setup (Beacon / ES-DE / Daijishou)" line sits alongside the Privacy/Credits links. Edited via `gh release edit` — release tag/assets/keystore unchanged, drop-in update unaffected.
- **`bannerhub-v6-lite.md`.** Added a "Front-end launcher support (Beacon / ES-DE / Daijishou)" section between the "what stays" list and the testing-status table, with the same `beacon-setup.md` pointer. Notes that the Lite package (`banner.hub.lite`) has its own action prefix and that the guide covers all 9 variants (full + Lite).

The README on both `gamehub-604-build` and `feature/lite-variant-tier1` already linked `beacon-setup.md` from the Frontend support section — this just closes the gap in the two surfaces (release page + Lite doc) that hadn't been refreshed.

No code/patch/CI changes; docs-only. Lite rebuild not required.

### Next

Refresh `feature/lite-variant-tier1` from `gamehub-604-build` for the Lite-doc edit (same `--no-ff` merge as prior docs polish).

## 2026-05-21 — Docs: beacon-setup walkthrough audit — fix Normal-GHL launcher label + disambiguation + table column

Audit of the "Beacon in-app walkthrough" section at the top of `beacon-setup.md`. One real correctness bug found, two gaps closed.

- **L23 bug fix.** Old walkthrough said *"select **GameHub Lite** for the Normal-GHL variant"* — wrong. `gamehub.lite` is only the **package name** (shared with Producdevity's BannerHub Lite project); the actual `android:label` set by our `ChangeAppNamePatch` for Normal-GHL is **"BannerHub v6"** (verified against `.github/workflows/release.yml` lines 133–141 for full and 146–154 for Lite). A user with both apps installed would have picked the wrong app entirely. Replaced with the correct launcher-label mapping and an example list covering all variants.
- **Shared-label disambiguation.** Added a callout noting that 3 variants share the label *"BannerHub v6"* (Normal / Normal-GHL / Original) and 2 share *"BannerHub v6 AnTuTu"* (AnTuTu / alt-AnTuTu). Points users to the package-name column to disambiguate, and clarifies that the `am start command` is the authoritative selector — the Player-app picker just decides the icon Beacon shows on the platform card.
- **Per-variant table column.** Added a **Launcher label** column to the "Per-variant configuration" table so the walkthrough's "pick the right app" step has an authoritative reference in the same doc. Also added " Lite" suffix note for Lite variants.

No code/patch/CI changes; docs-only. Lite rebuild not required.

### Next

Refresh `feature/lite-variant-tier1` from `gamehub-604-build` (--no-ff merge).

## 2026-05-21 — Docs: README **Frontend support** section + beacon-setup status refresh

Post-v1.5.1-604 docs polish. No code/patch changes; build artefacts unaffected.

- **README.md** — new top-level **Frontend support** section between Variants and Signing. Status table (Beacon ✅ / ES-DE ✅ device-verified / Daijishou ⚠️ untested), short note that PC-imported / Steam / Epic / GOG are all addressable as of v1.5.1-604, and a prominent link to [`beacon-setup.md`](beacon-setup.md) — same target the v1.5.0-604 release description used. TOC renumbered.
- **beacon-setup.md** — top status banner updated: ES-DE flipped to ✅ device-confirmed (slogik, v1.5.1-604); Epic Games library line flipped from ❌ unsupported (the old `app_nav_epic_app_name` upstream block) to ℹ️ supported via the synthetic-ID rewrite; GOG noted alongside. Renamed the stale "Games that DON'T work via Beacon dispatch" section to "Game type coverage" and replaced the negative bullet list with a positive 5-row coverage table (Steam / PC-imported catalog match / PC-imported `-1` / Epic `0` / GOG `0`) — all five now ✅, with the last three flagged "since v1.5.1-604".

### Next

Refresh `feature/lite-variant-tier1` from `gamehub-604-build` (--no-ff merge, docs-only — no Lite rebuild needed).

## 2026-05-21 — 🚀 v1.5.1-604 STABLE SHIPPED (hotfix)

Cut from `gamehub-604-build` after both feature merges landed earlier today (localgameid `c270672` + Banner Tools menu `0021862`). Stable keystore unchanged from v1.1.0+; cert SHA-256 `10895a311fe04f95f82e4da5c9a6c041ba9282bf211f1b578fe1cbeb894ce0ba`. 18 APKs attached (9 full + 9 Lite) + 3 `.rvp` bundles.

### Two changes on top of v1.5.0-604

1. **Imported / Epic / GOG games launch from external front-ends** — `feature/local-gameid-assignment` merged via `c270672`. PC-imported games whose catalog lookup missed (`server_game_id = -1`) and Epic-library + GOG-imported games (`server_game_id = 0`) get a stable synthetic 32-bit ID derived from the row's `local_<UUID>` so the deep-link contract (`Integer.parseInt(app_nav_game_id)`) can address each row individually. **Device-confirmed on Beacon (the412banner) AND ES-DE (slogik) for BOTH the `-1` AND `=0` cases — Epic and GOG games now launch end-to-end from external front-ends.** Earlier "separate dispatcher hook needed for Epic/GOG" speculation in the design doc is superseded: in practice the existing 6.0.4 source-type-specific launch paths fire correctly once each row has a distinct integer.
2. **Banner Tools consolidated menu** — `feature/banner-tools-menu` merged via `0021862` (pre2). Collapses the 4 BannerHub per-game menu rows (PC Vibration / GPU Spoof / Renderer / Show Game ID) into a single **Banner Tools** entry that opens a 1×4 icon-tile dialog. Less menu clutter; underlying feature patches unchanged.

### Docs

- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: refreshed `### What's new in ${version}` template body + bumped prior-stable reference from `v1.4.0-604` → `v1.5.0-604`.
- PROGRESS_LOG: this entry.
- Memory: `project_bannerhub_revanced_local_gameid_assignment.md` updated to record the Epic/GOG end-to-end device confirmation (supersedes the earlier "dispatcher hook still future" note).

### Known issues carried over (not regressions; pre-date v1.5.1)

- Steam-source and Epic-source games hide all 4 BannerHub More Menu rows on the game-details page. PC Game Settings ungate works on the same games (so `Lx57.a` IS invoked); root cause is downstream in `Lx57.o` row iteration. Not blocking v1.5.1.
- GOG WS4/5 add-to-GameHub-library work is **held separate by user directive** until the underlying add-to-library issues are resolved. Not shipped in v1.5.1.

---

## 2026-05-21 — local-gameid MERGED to gamehub-604-build + Lite refreshed

**What this patch fixes (plain language):** any library row whose `server_game_id` was a sentinel value — `-1` for imported PC games GameHub didn't recognize from its catalog, OR `0` for Epic-library and GOG-imported games — gets rewritten to a unique, stable integer in the 1.07B–2.15B range derived from the row's `local_<UUID>` id. That makes those previously-collision-stuck games individually addressable from external launchers.

Pre3 device-confirmed (-1 case via Beacon → 1,863,762,719 launches Blur) and pre4 (-1 + 0 predicate widening, build-green) merged into both branches.

### Device confirmations
- **Beacon** — confirmed by `the412banner` (project owner): previously-stuck imported game **Blur** (was `server_game_id = -1`) got synthetic `1,863,762,719` after the scan, and Beacon launches it via the existing ExternalLauncher patch.
- **ES-DE** — confirmed by user **slogik**: same `-1`→synthetic flow works through ES-DE's external-launch mechanism. Validates that the fix isn't Beacon-specific and rides every launcher that emits the standard `*.LAUNCH_GAME` intent contract.
- **Daijishou** — not yet device-confirmed but uses the same intent contract; expected to work without further changes.

- **`gamehub-604-build`** ← `feature/local-gameid-assignment` via `--no-ff` merge `c270672` ("Merge branch 'feature/local-gameid-assignment' — local game-id assignment for catalog-miss rows"). 3 files / +444 / 0 (new files only).
- **`feature/lite-variant-tier1`** ← `gamehub-604-build` via `--no-ff` merge `7e018e6` ("merge gamehub-604-build: local game-id assignment for catalog-miss rows"). PROGRESS_LOG.md conflict resolved in favor of incoming entries (Lite had no parallel changes).

  - `release.yml` on `feature/lite-variant-tier1` — run [26240298055](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26240298055) (version `1.5.0-604-local-gameid-merged-lite`)

Pre4 device-test for the `server_game_id=0` (Epic/GOG) path remains pending — user without Epic/GOG installed sees no behavior delta vs pre3 by design. Epic/GOG external launching still needs the separate dispatcher-hook patch (queued in `ExternalLauncher.java` doc-comment) — minting unique IDs was step 1 of that work.

## 2026-05-21 — feature/local-gameid-assignment pre4: extend to server_game_id=0 (Epic/GOG)

### Device-test result for pre3
User installed `local-gameid-pre3-Patched-Normal-GHL.apk` and confirmed the previously-stuck `-1` game (Blur) now shows `1,863,762,719` in "View All Games" and **launches successfully from Beacon** via the external-launcher path. This resolves the biggest open design risk (whether `GameDetailViewModel` would accept a synthetic `server_game_id` and find the local row, or whether it phones home to a catalog API). For PC-imported games (source_type=0) the lookup falls through to the local row data and the launch works without any catalog roundtrip.

### Scope extension: also handle server_game_id=0
`ExternalLauncher.java` doc comment documents that GameHub uses two sentinel values for "no catalog ID":
- `-1` for PC-imported games (source_type=0) whose title didn't match the PlayDay catalog at import time
- `0` for Epic-library games (source_type=2) and GOG-imported games, whose unique handle is the TEXT `id` column and where `server_game_id` is never populated

Both collide at the dispatch surface for the same reason — `DeepLinkActivity` parses `app_nav_game_id` as Integer and routes by that single value, so any number of rows sharing a sentinel can't be addressed individually.

Pre4 commit `49e28e1`: one-line predicate widening in `collectTargets`:

```diff
- WHERE server_game_id = -1
+ WHERE server_game_id IN (-1, 0)
```

Plus doc-comment + patch-description updates spelling out the broader scope and one important caveat:

**Unique IDs are necessary but not sufficient for Beacon/ES-DE launching of Epic/GOG games.** After the row lookup, the 6.0.4 deep-link dispatch takes a source-type-specific launch path; the Epic/GOG paths need their own dispatcher hook to actually start the game (the "queued future patch" the ExternalLauncher comment talks about — hooks the in-app library-tile Compose route through MainActivity instead of DeepLinkActivity). Pre4 handles step 1 of that work (unique addressable IDs) so the future dispatcher patch has something to hand off to.

### Pre4 CI
- Branch head: `49e28e1` on `feature/local-gameid-assignment`
- `release.yml` run [26239665214](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26239665214) ✅ all 9 variants green, `INFO: "Local game-id assignment" succeeded` on Normal-GHL, 0 SEVERE, 38 succeeded.
- APK staged: `/storage/emulated/0/Download/local-gameid-pre4/BannerHub-V6-1.5.0-604-local-gameid-pre4-Patched-Normal-GHL.apk` (md5 `a3116528fe217cfd6be28483f11708be`).

### Idempotence still holds
- Re-runs match only rows where `server_game_id IN (-1, 0)`. Any row already in `[0x40000000, 0x7FFFFFFF]` (a previously-minted synthetic), or holding any other positive value (a real catalog ID), is left alone on every subsequent app start.
- A user re-running GameHub's "search for matches" that finds a real catalog ID overwrites our synthetic; we don't fight that.
- For users with no Epic/GOG games installed, the change is a silent no-op — same observable behavior as pre3.

### Device-test resumption for pre4
1. Install `local-gameid-pre4-…-Normal-GHL.apk` over current build.
2. Confirm the previously-working `-1` flow still works (Blur → still launches via Beacon at `1,863,762,719`).
3. If you have Epic-library or GOG-imported games: open "View All Games" and confirm those rows now show distinct numbers in the 1.07B–2.15B range instead of `ID: 0`.
4. **Don't expect external launching of Epic/GOG games to work yet** — that's the deferred dispatcher-hook follow-up.
5. On success: merge `feature/local-gameid-assignment` → `gamehub-604-build` (--no-ff), refresh Lite (--no-ff).

## 2026-05-21 — feature/local-gameid-assignment pre1: synthesize server_game_id for -1 rows

### Background
A user-supplied screenshot of the "View All Games" dialog showed 3 imported PC games — Dispatch, Elementallis, Quartet — all displayed with `ID: -1`. Schema dump of `db_game_library.db` (`dbgl_dump.db`, on-device sample) confirms the value isn't a display artifact:

```
t_game_library_base.server_game_id INTEGER NOT NULL
  -1     | 'local_eMB3uA3zTMKX8hrx4mIkow'  | source_type=0  | 'Blur'          ← catalog miss
  49908  | 'local_PABUmurJS8u8D0wpv2BfDg'  | source_type=0  | 'God of War'    ← real GH id
  131962 | 'local_McKtgYBRTPqk0LhFYFKIeQ'  | source_type=0  | 'Dirt 3'        ← real GH id
  135805 | 'local_Nh0ZuHZBRgqjBli7rKceRQ'  | source_type=0  | 'PRAGMATA'      ← real GH id
```

GameHub assigns `server_game_id = -1` to PC-imported games when its catalog lookup finds no match. Every unmatched game collapses to the same `-1`, which collides at `DeepLinkActivity` because the deep-link dispatch parses `app_nav_game_id` as Integer (per `ExternalLauncher.java` doc comment). Beacon / ES-DE / Daijishou therefore can't address those games individually — they show up in the library and play fine in-app, but won't launch from external front ends.

### Fix design
New patch + extension that rewrites every `-1` row to a stable synthetic integer:

```
synthetic = (id.hashCode() & 0x3FFFFFFF) | 0x40000000
          ∈ [0x40000000, 0x7FFFFFFF]
          ∈ [1,073,741,824, 2,147,483,647]
```

- **Stable** — `id` is the `local_<UUID>` TEXT assigned by GameHub at game-import time and never rewritten across app restarts, library refreshes, or game moves. `String.hashCode()` is JLS-spec-stable.
- **Collision-safe** — 2^30 value space; birthday-paradox 50% threshold ≈ 32 768 games. Effectively zero for the few hundred unmatched games a single user accumulates.
- **Range-safe** — fits Java's signed 32-bit Integer (required by 6.0.4's `Integer.parseInt(app_nav_game_id)`); never collides with real GameHub catalog IDs (~10^5 in observed samples) or Steam appids (~10^7).
- **Idempotent + self-healing** — re-runs match only `server_game_id = -1`, so previously-assigned synthetic rows stay put, and if GameHub later overwrites a row with a real catalog ID, we stop touching it.

### Files added
- `extensions/gamehub/src/main/java/app/revanced/extension/gamehub/localgameid/LocalGameIdAssignment.java`
  - Public entrypoint `scanAndAssign(Context)` invoked from the bytecode hook.
  - Single-shot daemon thread (priority MIN) so Application.onCreate never waits on disk I/O.
  - Opens `db_game_library.db` `OPEN_READWRITE` (WAL-compatible with GameHub's own writer).
  - SELECT `_id, id` WHERE `server_game_id = -1`; per row computes the synthetic; UPDATE in a single transaction keyed by `_id`; logs `assigned synthetic server_game_id to N row(s)`.
  - All throwables caught and logged — Application startup never gated on this.
- `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/localgameid/LocalGameIdAssignmentPatch.kt`
  - Anchors on `Lcom/xiaoji/egggame/BaseAndroidApp;->onCreate()V` (stable non-mangled class name confirmed via `DisableMobPushPatch`).
  - Injects one `invoke-static` at index 0 passing `p0` (the Application "this" reference, a Context) to `LocalGameIdAssignment.scanAndAssign`.
  - Verifier-safe: single void-returning invoke, no v0 reuse, no move-result.
  - Depends on `sharedGamehubExtensionPatch`.

### Hash sanity-check (Python-equivalent of Java String.hashCode())
```
local_eMB3uA3zTMKX8hrx4mIkow → 1,566,639,775 (0x5D61069F) ✓ in range
local_PABUmurJS8u8D0wpv2BfDg → 2,072,875,144 (0x7B8D9088) ✓ in range
local_McKtgYBRTPqk0LhFYFKIeQ → 1,819,924,988 (0x6C79D9FC) ✓ in range
local_Nh0ZuHZBRgqjBli7rKceRQ → 1,367,434,163 (0x518163B3) ✓ in range
```
All four distinct, all positive, all inside `[0x40000000, 0x7FFFFFFF]`. The first row (Blur, currently at -1) would become `1,566,639,775` after the first onCreate. The other three are already non-negative real catalog IDs and the scanner leaves them alone.

### Branch
- `feature/local-gameid-assignment` off `gamehub-604-build@616d0ea`
- Commits:
  - `6e404e5` — extension (scanner)
  - `acc7dfe` — patch (BaseAndroidApp.onCreate hook)
  - `a1b218d` — docs (this entry's earlier draft)

  - `480e1c1` — fix: `move-object/from16 v0, p0` before invoke-static for high-register encoding (pre2 → pre3)
- Pre1 CI: run [26235997506](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26235997506) — SEVERE on all 9 variants.
- Pre2 CI: run [26236629500](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26236629500) — still SEVERE.
- Pre3 CI: run [26237217658](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26237217658) ✅ all 9 variants, **`INFO: "Local game-id assignment" succeeded`**, 0 SEVERE, 38 patches succeeded on Normal-GHL.
- APK staged: `/storage/emulated/0/Download/local-gameid-pre3/BannerHub-V6-1.5.0-604-local-gameid-pre3-Patched-Normal-GHL.apk` (~111 MB).

### Pre1 / pre2 / pre3 — what went wrong, what fixed it
**Pre1 failure (all 9 variants):** `SEVERE: "Local game-id assignment" failed: NullPointerException — Cannot invoke ClassDef.getMethods() because "classDef" is null` at `Instruction.kt:114` inside `addInstructions`. Initial hypothesis: `firstMethod` matched a method REFERENCE (from some subclass's invoke-super) instead of the concrete `BaseAndroidApp.onCreate` definition.

**Pre2 fix:** Added `implementation != null` to the `firstMethod` predicate (the Mob patch's implicit filter). **Did not resolve the SEVERE** — identical NPE.

**Real root cause (found by disassembling the base APK):** `BaseAndroidApp.onCreate` is declared `.registers 55` with 1 parameter (`this`), so `p0` resolves to `v54`. `invoke-static` encodes its register list with 4-bit nibbles (max v15). My pre1/pre2 snippet `invoke-static {p0}, ...` could not be encoded → smali parser failed deep inside Patcher's instruction-construction code, surfacing as the `classDef is null` NPE rather than a clearer "register out of range" error.

**Pre3 fix:** Mirror the working pattern from `ExternalLauncherPatch` — emit `move-object/from16 v0, p0` first (encoded as 16-bit dest + 16-bit src, valid for any register), then `invoke-static {v0}, ...`. The original `BaseAndroidApp.onCreate` opens with the same `move-object/from16 v0, p0`, so our prepended pair is shape-consistent and the verifier accepts the join cleanly.

### Lessons captured (memory)
- Any patch injecting into a method with `.registers > 16` MUST move high-register parameters into v0–v15 before any 3rc/35c-encoded invoke. The clearer "register out of range" surfaces as the cryptic `classDef is null` NPE from Patcher; if you see that NPE, check `.registers N` on the target method first.
- `firstMethod` predicate should always include `implementation != null` to avoid matching method references vs definitions — even when not strictly required, it eliminates a class of error.

### Device-test resumption order
1. Install `local-gameid-pre3-Patched-Normal-GHL.apk` over current build.
2. Open GameHub; confirm "View All Games" dialog no longer shows `ID: -1` for unmatched imports (each shows a number in the 1.07B–2.15B range).
3. In Beacon / ES-DE / Daijishou, configure a launch entry for one previously-unlaunchable game using the new ID; confirm launch.
4. Optional: copy ID from one game, kill app, reopen, verify same ID — confirms `String.hashCode()` stability across process restarts.
5. On success: merge to `gamehub-604-build` (--no-ff), refresh Lite (--no-ff), per the standard merge workflow.



### Why no UI changes
The scanner has no UI of its own and adds no menu rows — it's a silent fix. The existing "View All Games" dialog and "Show Game ID" menu row will both stop showing `-1` for these rows after the scan runs (they query the same `server_game_id` column). External launcher routing continues to work via the existing `ExternalLauncher` extension; no changes there.

### Not enrolled into Banner Tools
Per the enrollment rule, only patches that ADD a new top-level menu row need to enroll into Banner Tools. This patch is invisible at the UI level — no row to enroll.

## 2026-05-21 — Banner Tools pre2 MERGED to gamehub-604-build + Lite refreshed

Device-confirmed pre2 (1×4 tile dialog, 56dp vector icons) merged into both branches.

- **`gamehub-604-build`** ← `feature/banner-tools-menu` via `--no-ff` merge commit `0021862` ("Merge branch 'feature/banner-tools-menu' — Banner Tools consolidated menu (pre2)"). 13 files / +1050 / −9.
- **`feature/lite-variant-tier1`** ← `gamehub-604-build` via `--no-ff` merge commit `1f07d33` ("merge gamehub-604-build: Banner Tools consolidated menu (pre2)"). 14 files / +1053 / −10 (extra delta = README link auto-merge).
- Validation CI on the merge tips:
  - `release.yml` on `gamehub-604-build` — run [26231488560](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26231488560)
  - `release.yml` on `feature/lite-variant-tier1` — run [26231454988](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26231454988)
- Going-forward rule recorded in memory (`feedback_banner_tools_enrollment.md`): any new BannerHub patch that adds a row to the More Menu or Library-Tile popup MUST also enroll the feature into the Banner Tools consolidated dialog (drawable + arrays + dispatch case) and wrap its standalone `*MenuRowPatch` injection blocks in `if (false)`. Default = enroll; standalone is the exception, not the norm.

## 2026-05-21 — feature/banner-tools-menu pre2: custom-icon 1×4 tile dialog (56dp vectors)

### Decisions locked (user, 2026-05-21)
1. **Icon size in dialog:** 56dp
2. **Backgrounds:** keep self-contained dark Material 3 surface-container tiles (no host-theme tinting)
3. **Ship format:** Android vector drawable XML

### New files
- `patches/src/main/resources/banner-tools/bh_bt_vibration.xml`
- `patches/src/main/resources/banner-tools/bh_bt_gpu_spoof.xml`
- `patches/src/main/resources/banner-tools/bh_bt_renderer.xml`
- `patches/src/main/resources/banner-tools/bh_bt_game_id.xml`

  Mechanical SVG → vector-drawable conversion of the 4 SVG templates archived in `/storage/emulated/0/Download/banner-tools-custom-icons-preview.html`. 512×512 viewport, 56dp intrinsic size, dark rounded-rect background path baked in (rx=112). Conversion rules: `<rect>` → multi-arc rounded-rect path; `<circle>` → 2-arc path; `transform="rotate(...)"` → `<group android:pivotX/Y android:rotation>`; `opacity="0.85"` → `android:fillAlpha`; `stroke-opacity="0.5"` → `android:strokeAlpha`.

  **Known conversion loss:** the GPU Spoof chip outline used SVG `stroke-dasharray="16 12"`, which Android VectorDrawable does not support. Shipped as a solid stroke instead — chip silhouette still reads, just less "blueprint-esque." If the user later vetoes this, alternatives are (a) pre-compute 24+ short line segments around the rounded-rect perimeter, or (b) drop the chip outline entirely and rely on the 6 pin marks for chip identity.

- `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/bannertools/BannerToolsDrawablesPatch.kt` — `resourcePatch` that ships the 4 vectors as new entries in `res/drawable/` of the staged APK. Mirrors the classloader-read pattern from `ChangeAppIconPatch`. Resource IDs are assigned by apktool/aapt2 at reassembly; runtime resolution is via `Resources.getIdentifier("bh_bt_*", "drawable", pkgName)` since the host R class is in the foreign package.

### Modified files
- `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/bannertools/BannerToolsMenuRowPatch.kt` — added `bannerToolsDrawablesPatch` to `dependsOn(...)` so the 4 drawables are guaranteed present before the bytecode patch applies.

- `extensions/gamehub/src/main/java/com/xj/winemu/bannertools/BhBannerToolsMenuRowClick.java` — `showDialog()` rewritten:
  - **Old (pre1):** `AlertDialog.Builder().setTitle(...).setItems(STRING_ARRAY, ...)` text list, 4 long labels.
  - **New (pre2):** `setView(buildTileRow(...))` — programmatically built `LinearLayout` HORIZONTAL with 4 children, each a vertical tile (`ImageView` 56dp + `TextView` short label). Short labels: **Vibration / GPU Spoof / Renderer / Game ID**.
  - Tile interaction: `selectableItemBackground` ripple, `clickable=true`, `focusable=true`. Per-tile click handler captures the tile index and dispatches into the same 4 per-feature handlers (`BhMenuRowClick` / `BhGpuSpoofMenuRowClick` / `BhRendererMenuRowClick` / `BhGameIdDisplayMenuRowClick`), then dismisses the dialog.
  - Cancel-only action button (no OK) — `setNegativeButton(android.R.string.cancel, null)`.
  - Drawables resolved at runtime via `res.getIdentifier(drawableName, "drawable", pkgName)` because the static R class belongs to GameHub's package, not BannerHub's. Missing-drawable case logs and falls through (tile renders without an icon rather than crashing).
  - `dp(float density, int dp)` helper added; programmatic view construction avoids needing to inject an XML layout into the foreign package.

### Why programmatic view (not XML layout)
Injecting a new `res/layout/bh_banner_tools_dialog.xml` would mean adding a new layout entry to the staged APK's resource table and either reflectively resolving its ID or hardcoding one. Programmatic construction sidesteps both — only the 4 drawables ride along, which apktool handles cleanly (proven by `ChangeAppIconPatch`).

### CI — both runs green
- **`build_pull_request` run [26228524223](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26228524223)** ✅ (1m55s) — patches bundle compile-only sanity check.
- **`release.yml` workflow_dispatch run [26228708841](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26228708841)** ✅ — full pipeline: build patches bundle → revanced-cli matrix across all 9 variants → resign with BannerHub test key → upload `apk-*` artifacts. Triggered with `version="1.5.0-604-banner-tools-pre2"` and `stable=false` (per pre-release policy after v1.5.0-604 stable; the `Create GitHub Release` job is correctly skipped). All 9 patch jobs `success`. `Patch Normal-GHL` log shows `INFO: "Banner Tools drawables" succeeded` + `INFO: "Banner Tools menu row" succeeded`, zero `SEVERE`, output 116.1 MB pre-resign.

### APK verification
Downloaded `apk-Normal-GHL` artifact and verified the 4 vector drawables landed inside the APK:
```
res/drawable/bh_bt_game_id.xml    (2028 B)
res/drawable/bh_bt_gpu_spoof.xml  (2252 B)
res/drawable/bh_bt_renderer.xml   (4056 B)
res/drawable/bh_bt_vibration.xml  (2268 B)
```
All 4 names match the runtime `Resources.getIdentifier("bh_bt_*", "drawable", pkg)` lookup keys in `BhBannerToolsMenuRowClick.buildTile`.

### Staged for device test
`/storage/emulated/0/Download/banner-tools-pre2/BannerHub-V6-1.5.0-604-banner-tools-pre2-Patched-Normal-GHL.apk` (≈111 MB, BannerHub test key signature unchanged from pre1 — in-place update over pre1).

### Open follow-ups (after device test of pre2)
- Confirm icon legibility at 56dp on user's device (font scale, screen density).
- If GPU Spoof dashed-outline absence is too jarring, swap to alternative (a) or (b) above.
- Once pre2 lands, address the Lx57.o Steam/Epic hide bug (separate from this branch — see `[[project_bannerhub_revanced]]` known-issue block).

## 2026-05-21 — feature/banner-tools-menu: pre1 device-tested + Layout 2 picked + custom icons received

### Device test result
Pre1 (text-list `AlertDialog`) installed from `/storage/emulated/0/Download/banner-tools-pre1/BannerHub-V6-1.5.0-604-banner-tools-pre1-Patched-Normal-GHL.apk` and confirmed working on device — single "Banner Tools" row appears at all 3 menu sites; tap opens the 4-item list; each item routes into the correct per-feature handler. No regressions to the 4 underlying settings activities / dialogs.

### Dialog UX iteration → Layout 2 picked
Mocked 3 dialog layouts in `/storage/emulated/0/Download/banner-tools-dialog-mockups.html` (Material 3 styled, 28dp rounded, light+dark adaptive). User picked **Variant 2 — 1×4 horizontal row of icon+label tiles**. Labels shortened to fit 4 tiles in a 360dp dialog: **Vibration / GPU Spoof / Renderer / Game ID** (vs pre1's longer "PC Vibration Settings" / "Show Game ID"). Cancel-only action button.

### Custom icons received
User supplied 4 self-contained SVG tiles (512×512 viewBox, 22% corner ratio, dark Material 3 surface-container backgrounds, multi-color hardcoded fills — no auto theme tinting):
- **Vibration** — controller body + dpad + 2 action buttons + 4 haptic wave arcs (`#FFD284` waves, `#E6E1E5` controller)
- **GPU Spoof** — spy/bandit mask over a dashed-outline chip with 6 pin marks (`#D0BCFF` mask, `#381E72` hat)
- **Renderer** — inner chip (`#2D3033` + `#006684` outline) + 12 outer pin pads + Android-bot core with shader grid (`#00E676` bot, `#A3EDFF` grid bars)
- **Game ID** — ID badge with avatar circle + barcode rows + decorative slot (`#BFC2C9` avatar, `#FFB4AB` accent bars)

Full SVG markup preserved as JS templates in the preview HTML below — re-extract from there if originals are lost.

### Preview HTML
Written to `/storage/emulated/0/Download/banner-tools-custom-icons-preview.html`. Shows:
- Layout 2 at 48dp / 56dp / 64dp icon sizes, light + dark themes side-by-side
- Per-icon size sampler (32 / 40 / 48 / 64 / 96 px) so user can judge detail legibility
- Pre1 text-list vs Layout 2 with custom icons A/B

### Pending decisions before next code change
1. **Icon size in dialog:** 48dp / 56dp / 64dp — recommended 56dp; 64dp would need dialog widened to ~400dp
2. **Self-contained dark backgrounds:** keep as-is (always dark squares, bold visual identity) vs strip the first `<rect>` from each so glyphs sit on the dialog's own chip background and pick up host theme tinting
3. **Ship format:** Android vector drawable XML (recommended — ~1–2 KB/icon, mechanical SVG→XML conversion since shapes are plain `<rect>`/`<circle>`/`<path>`/`<g>` with `transform="rotate(...)"`) vs PNG raster (20 files across 5 density buckets × 4 icons)

### No code changes this session
Branch head still `e156467` (pre1 scaffold). All work was UX/asset discussion — implementation of the new dialog + custom icons happens next session once the 3 pending decisions are answered.

## 2026-05-21 — feature/banner-tools-menu pre1 (scaffold)

Cut new branch off `gamehub-604-build@661a82d` for the Banner Tools menu-consolidation experiment listed in v1.5.0-604's "Upcoming features" section. Goal: collapse the 4 per-game More Menu rows (PC Vibration / GPU Spoof / Renderer / Show Game ID) into a single "Banner Tools" entry whose tap opens an `AlertDialog` listing the 4 sub-features. Each item dispatches into the existing per-feature handlers (`new BhMenuRowClick().invoke(null)`, etc.) so all settings activities / dialogs / prefs are reused unchanged.

### Scope (test branch — not for stable)
- Pure consolidation. Lx57.o Steam/Epic hide bug **deferred**.
- The 4 standalone *MenuRow patches are wrapped in `if (false) { @Suppress("UNREACHABLE_CODE") ... }` so their row injections do not run — the patches remain compiled and apply cleanly, but emit zero bytecode at the 3 menu sites. The shared `Lxd3;->l1` resolver hook in `VibrationMenuRowPatch` is **kept** (outside the `if (false)`) since `BannerToolsMenuRowPatch` reuses it for its Injection-3 Lell label sentinel.
- Per-feature settings code (`BhVibrationSettingsActivity`, `BhGpuSpoofSettingsActivity`, `BhRendererSettingsActivity`, gameId dialog) is untouched.

### New files
- `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/bannertools/BannerToolsMenuRowPatch.kt` — structural clone of `GpuSpoofMenuRowPatch`; injects one row at all 3 standard sites (`Lx57;->a`, `Lted;->f`, `Lpzc;->j0`). `dependsOn(menuGameIdCapturePatch, vibrationMenuRowPatch)` for the shared `Lxd3;->l1` resolver.
- `extensions/gamehub/src/main/java/com/xj/winemu/bannertools/BhBannerToolsMenuRowClick.java` — 3 `appendRow*` builders + `invoke()` that pops an `AlertDialog` with 4 items dispatching via `new <Sibling>().invoke(null)`. Sentinel key `"string:bh_banner_tools_label"`.

### Modified files
- `extensions/gamehub/src/main/java/com/xj/winemu/vibration/BhMenuRowClick.java` — added `"string:bh_banner_tools_label" → "Banner Tools"` mapping in `maybeResolveCustomLabel`.
- 4 × `*MenuRowPatch.kt` — wrapped the existing 3-site injection blocks in `if (false) { ... }`. Header comment in each explains how to revert (parent commit `661a82d`).

### Build
Push to fork → CI builds via `Any branch compilation` workflow (per `[[feedback_ci_workflows]]`). No CI matrix changes.

## 2026-05-21 — 🚀 v1.5.0-604 STABLE SHIPPED

Cut from `gamehub-604-build` at HEAD `af40a90` (PR #6 merge) — Lite refresh on `feature/lite-variant-tier1` at `af522a2` (merge of 604 into Lite). Stable keystore unchanged from v1.1.0+; cert SHA-256 `10895a311fe04f95f82e4da5c9a6c041ba9282bf211f1b578fe1cbeb894ce0ba`. 18 APKs attached (9 full + 9 Lite) + 3 `.rvp` bundles.

### Four headline changes on top of v1.4.0-604

1. **External launcher integration (Beacon / ES-DE / Daijishou)** — `feature/external-launcher` merged via `cec34f0`. Port of PlayDay's 5.3.5 patch forward to the 6.0.4 base. Intents accept both `--ei` (int) and `--es` (String) extras. Epic Games attempted across pre1–pre5 and dropped — the upstream `GameDetailViewModel` ignores the `app_nav_epic_app_name` route. PC + Steam ship working end-to-end.
2. **Show Game ID menu row + View All Games dialog** — `feature/menu-gameid-display` merged via `090706e`. New per-game menu row pops a dialog with the gameId + Copy button + "View All Games" button that opens the full library list backed by `db_game_library.db`.
3. **Proper menu row icons (TideGear PR #6)** — merged via `af40a90`. Vibration / GPU Spoof / Renderer rows previously read `zz4.m` (the Remove-from-Library trash icon); each now reads its correct icon field (`zz4.b0` / `zz4.v` / `zz4.c0` respectively).
4. **Portrait layout for PC Vibration Settings dialog (TideGear PR #6)** — same merge. Dialog detects orientation, stacks Mode + Intensity vertically in portrait at `min(360dp, screenW - 24dp)` width, intensity slider caps at 220dp. Landscape unchanged.

### Docs

- README: bumped latest-stable badge + link to v1.5.0-604, rewrote "What's new" section, rotated v1.4.0 into the past-release archive line.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: refreshed the `### What's new in ${version}` template body + changed prior-stable reference from `v1.3.0-604` → `v1.4.0-604`.
- PROGRESS_LOG: this entry.
- Memory: updated `project_bannerhub_revanced.md` with new active state.

### Known issue (not blocking — flagged for next investigation)

Steam-source and Epic-source games (e.g. Brawlhalla Steam id 291550, Doomblade Epic id 0) hide all 4 of our More Menu rows (Vibration / GPU Spoof / Renderer / Show Game ID) on the game-details page More Menu. PC Game Settings ungate works on the same games, confirming `Lx57.a` IS being invoked. A finalize-anchor fix (move injection from `lastIdx(Lx9d->add) + 1` to `firstIdx(Lqs2->v finalize)`) was built and device-tested on `fix/menu-row-anchor-merge-point` — did NOT resolve the issue, branch deleted. Root cause is downstream in `Lx57.o` row iteration (the 2×2 icon grid renderer at line 333+); not yet bottomed out. Tracked separately; not blocking v1.5.0-604.

## 2026-05-01 — GameHub 6.0 port session

### Goal
Port the existing 5.3.5 ReVanced patches to GameHub 6.0.0 (`com.xiaoji.egggame` KMP rewrite).

### Branch
`gamehub-600-build` — forked from `playday-build`, retargeted to `GameHub_beta_6.0.0_global.apk`

### Completed fixes

#### 1. CI compile error (commit `e1a6a12`)
- `getInstruction<Instruction>(...)` — patcher v22 does NOT accept type parameters
- Fix: remove `import com.android.tools.smali.dexlib2.iface.Instruction`, use bare `getInstruction(idx)`

#### 2. Firebase Crashlytics crash-on-launch — VerifyError (commit `2437dca`)
- **Root cause:** Original `DisableCrashlyticsPatch` used a `goto` to skip the Crashlytics block.
  At the join point, v2 had type `String` (goto path) vs `Boolean` (fall-through path) → ART VerifyError.
- **Fix:** Remove all 3 Crashlytics instructions in **reverse order**:
  - `setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled` (endIdx)
  - `move-result-object` (getInstanceIdx + 1)
  - `invoke-static getInstance` (getInstanceIdx)
  This leaves the `const/4 v2, 0x0` between them in place, which redefines v2 String→Boolean and satisfies the ART verifier at the join point.

#### 3. TokenProvider.<clinit> dead-code removal (commit `aab98d7`)
- **Root cause:** `TokenProvider.loginBypassed` is `static boolean = false` — Java does NOT generate
  `<clinit>` for default-value static fields. `firstMethod { name == "<clinit>" }` threw "Required value was null".
- **Fix:** Remove the entire `TokenProvider.<clinit>` patching block plus the `addInstructions`,
  `TOKEN_PROVIDER_CLASS`, and `sharedGamehubExtensionPatch` imports/dependencies.

#### 4. Bypass login — complete rewrite for 6.0 (commit `f53a74d`)
- **Root cause:** `UserManager` class (`Lcom/xj/common/user/UserManager;`) is gone in 6.0.
  All 5 `firstMethod { definingClass == USER_MANAGER_CLASS }` calls threw "Required value was null".
  `HomeLeftMenuDialog` also renamed/restructured.
- **6.0 architecture analysis (via apktool decompile of `GameHub_beta_6.0.0_global.apk`):**
  - Login state is now managed by `Lis0;` interface with two implementations:
    - `Los0;` — real DB-backed impl using `UserDao` + `AuthTokenDao` (Room database), StateFlow initialized to `Boolean.FALSE`
    - `Lah;` — `os0` decorator that hardcodes `a()=true` and wraps StateFlow with `Boolean.TRUE`
  - `Lg8e;` is the navigator class (holds `is0` as field `b`)
  - Two methods in `g8e` gate Login navigation by calling `is0.a()`:
    - `g8e.i(Lrh0;)V` — guards via `iget Lg8e;->b → invoke-interface Lis0;->a() → if-nez → new Lga0;`
    - `g8e.r(Lrh0;)V` — same pattern with different register (v1 vs v3)
  - `Lga0;` is the Login navigation intent
- **Fix:** For both methods `i` and `r`:
  - Find `iget-object vN, p0, Lg8e;->b:Lis0;` → get register N
  - Remove `invoke-interface {vN}, Lis0;->a()Z` (igetIdx+1)
  - Remove `move-result vN` (igetIdx+2, removed first to keep indices stable)
  - Insert `const/4 vN, 0x1` at igetIdx+1
  - Result: `if-nez vN, :skipLogin` always branches → Login navigation never reached

### CI results

| Test tag | Run ID | "Bypass login" | "Disable Firebase Crashlytics" | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.0.1-600-test | 25215699388 | SEVERE | SEVERE | Compile error (getInstruction type param) |
| v0.0.2-600-test | ~25218... | SEVERE | SEVERE | goto approach → VerifyError crash |
| v0.0.3-600-test | 25220... | SEVERE | ✅ INFO | Crashlytics fixed; login still failing (TokenProvider.<clinit>) |
| v0.0.4-600-test | 25222889321 | SEVERE | ✅ INFO | TokenProvider block removed; login still failing (UserManager gone) |
| v0.0.5-600-test | 25224133234 | ✅ INFO | ✅ INFO | Login bypass rewritten for 6.0 g8e navigator |

### Pending (other patches still failing)

All remaining patches target 5.3.5 class names not present in 6.0. Each needs:
1. `apktool d` decompile + grep for the target functionality
2. Find the 6.0 equivalent class/method
3. Rewrite the patch fingerprint and bytecode manipulation

Known failing patches and root causes:
- **appNullSafetyPatch** → targets `Lcom/xj/app/App;` (renamed in 6.0)
- **bypassTokenExpiryPatch** → targets `RouterUtils$checkGuideStep$1` (renamed)
- **settingsMenuPatch** → UI classes renamed
- **errorHandlingPatch** → `NetErrorHandler$DefaultImpls` renamed
- **tokenResolutionPatch** → `UserManager.getToken()` gone
- Everything that depends on these (cascade failures via "patch failed previously")

### Local resources
- 6.0 APK decompile: `/tmp/gh600_smali/` (rebuilt from `GameHub_beta_6.0.0_global.apk` via apktool each session — `/tmp/` is ephemeral)
- 6.0 APK local copy: `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/GameHub_beta_6.0.0_global.apk`
- To rebuild smali: `java -jar ~/apktool.jar d ~/GameHub_beta_6.0.0_global.apk -o /tmp/gh600_smali -f --no-res`

### v0.0.6 / v0.0.7 / v0.0.8 incremental fixes (post-v0.0.5)

| Tag | Commit | Patch added |
|---|---|---|
| v0.0.6 | `65f2349` | `os0.h()` → `MutableStateFlow(Boolean.TRUE)` — NavHost `collectAsState()` had been picking Login as start destination because StateFlow init was FALSE |
| v0.0.7 | `21b151f` | `xm7.f()` → `"99999"` — game-import save was hitting null UID null-check in `xm7.u()` and short-circuiting to FALSE |
| v0.0.8 | `02195ff` | New `DebugLogPatch.kt` — sets `android:debuggable="true"` and prepends `Log.e("GH600-DEBUG", "y2d.e caught", t)` to `odb.e()` so swallowed exceptions surface in logcat |

### v0.0.8 device test result (2026-05-01, log_2026_05_01_17_04_18.log)

- Login is bypassed cleanly ✅ — landed on home screen, no Login route
- Game import dialog opens, can select APK + metadata
- Tap Save → dialog dismisses with no toast → game does NOT appear in library ❌

Decompiled v0.0.8 APK to verify all three patches were live:
- ✅ `android:debuggable="true"` set in `<application>`
- ✅ `"GH600-DEBUG"` in `odb.smali:129`
- ✅ `xm7.f()` returns `"99999"`
- ✅ `os0.h()` returns `r8o.r(Boolean.TRUE)`

Logcat shows NO `GH600-DEBUG y2d.e caught` line — meaning `xm7.u()` did NOT throw an exception. So the save use case `q1d.a()` got `Boolean.TRUE` back from `xm7.u()` (dialog dismissed cleanly because save reported success). But the row still doesn't appear in the library list.

#### Root-cause analysis (smali trace)

`xm7.u()` flow at `smali_classes5/xm7.smali:13667`:
1. `invoke-virtual xm7.f()` → "99999"
2. `if-nez :cond_3` (non-null, branch taken)
3. Build `fl7` lambda with userId="99999"
4. `withTransaction { fl7.invoke() }` → `el7.invokeSuspend` → `GameLibraryBaseDao.insert` (line 922 of `el7.smali`)
5. Return `Boolean.TRUE`

Local readers (`xm7.p`, `xm7.s`) ALSO call `xm7.f()` for their `WHERE user_id = ?` filters. So the writer and these specific readers are consistent on "99999".

But `is0.f()` is called directly by **other** consumers — `lvd` (network request prep, reads `l4m.b` username), `aae` (synthetic property-getter lambda), `fh2`, `dt0`, `sak`, `w79`, `kpl`, `dlk`, `npl`. The auth-token StateFlow that backs `is0.f()` is built off `AuthTokenDao.observeCurrent()` and emits null when the table is empty. With our login bypass there's no `auth_token` row in the DB, so `is0.f()` returns null, and any refresh/library-list signal that keys off this Flow stays in an "empty" state regardless of what's in `t_game_library_base`.

#### Fix planned for v0.0.9

Patch `is0.f()` (the interface default method in `is0.smali`) to return a non-null synthetic `l4m` constructed via reflection in a Java extension helper.

**New file:** `extensions/gamehub/src/main/java/app/revanced/extension/gamehub/login/FakeAuthToken.java`
- `get()` reflectively constructs `Class.forName("l4m")` with `(a="99999", b="", c..f=null, g=h=i=j=0)`, caches in volatile static
- Logs to `GH600-DEBUG` tag on success/failure

**`BypassLoginPatch.kt`:**
- Adds patch to `Lis0;->f()Ll4m;` — removes its 6 original instructions (`invoke-interface d()` → `getValue()` → `check-cast Ll4m;` → `return-object`) and replaces with `invoke-static FakeAuthToken.get()` → `check-cast Ll4m;` → `return-object`
- Keeps existing `xm7.f()`="99999" patch as redundant safety net (and so xm7's local cache logic stays consistent)
- Keeps the `g8e.i/r` navigator bypass and `os0.h()`=TRUE

## 2026-05-01 evening — Save-button silent-failure investigation

### Symptom
Bypass-login works (no Login screen), but **clicking Import → fill game form → Save** does not add the game to the library. Repeated tests show no rows ever appear in the library UI.

### Test 1 — v0.0.9-600-test (commit `59ab364`)
Existing patches: xm7.u ENTRY/CATCH probes, odb.e Throwable hook. DebugTrace writes to file at `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.xiaoji.egggame/files/gh600-debug.log` AND Log.e.

Reproduction with `getlog -n 15000 com.xiaoji.egggame` after Save:
- 10251 lines captured, **0 GH600-DEBUG entries, 0 E-level lines from the app** (66 D, 10146 I, 38 W).

Hypothesis: this device (or kernel build) filters app-tagged Log.e for non-system uids. File output unreachable from PRoot due to scoped storage.

### Test 2 — v0.1.0-600-test (commit `ac86a5f`, CI 25237506742 ✅)
Changes:
- DebugTrace switches from `Log.e` to `Log.i` (Log.i lines ARE reaching logcat per the test-1 capture).
- DebugTrace adds zero-arg markers `markY4iUpsert()`, `markFakeAuth()` for probes inserted into methods with `.locals 0`.
- New probe at `y4i.b` ENTRY (RetroGameDao upsert wrapper).
- `FakeAuthToken.get()` now logs on every call, not only on first construction.

Reproduction:
- `xm7.u ENTRY` fires **once** at 19:33:23.935 ✓
- `xm7.u CATCH` fires **0** times — transaction did not throw
- `FakeAuthToken.get() called` fires **45×** — bypass-login pathway is alive
- `y4i.b ENTRY` fires **0** — RetroGameDao not touched
- `y2d.e caught` fires **0**

### Conclusion of Test 2
xm7.u runs successfully end-to-end without exception, yet nothing lands in the library. `y4i.b` was a red herring — `RetroGameDao` is for retro emulators only. Re-tracing xm7.u smali (`smali_classes4/xm7.smali` line 13663) shows the actual write path:

```
xm7.u
  ├─ early bail: if xm7.f() returns null → return Boolean.FALSE     [line 13822]
  └─ withTransaction(GameLibraryDatabase, fl7) → fl7.invokeSuspend
       └─ withTransaction body: el7.invokeSuspend (.locals 69)
            ├─ build GameLaunchMethodTable, setLinkedGameId
            ├─ GameLaunchMethodDao.insert(table, cont)               ← line 609 in el7.smali
            ├─ build GameLibraryBaseTable via oh7.c(GameInfo)
            └─ GameLibraryBaseDao.insert(table, cont)                ← line 922 in el7.smali
```

The actual main-library writes are inside `el7.invokeSuspend` against `GameLibraryDatabase` — separate database from `RetroGameDatabase`.

### Test 3 — v0.1.1-600-test (commit `0892555`, CI 25237940015)
Added probes:
- `el7.invokeSuspend` ENTRY → confirms transaction body started
- `GameLaunchMethodDao.insert` PRE → marker right before INVOKE_INTERFACE
- `GameLibraryBaseDao.insert` PRE → marker right before INVOKE_INTERFACE

Implementation: `addInstructions` walked from highest target index to lowest so earlier insertions don't shift later targets. All three markers route through `DebugTrace.markEl7Entry()` / `markLaunchInsert()` / `markLibraryInsert()` (no-arg statics) since el7.invokeSuspend doesn't have free local registers everywhere.

**Branching logic for next reproduction:**
- el7 ENTRY missing → xm7.u took the early `Boolean.FALSE` branch (xm7.f() patch silently shadowed somehow)
- el7 ENTRY hit, no insert markers → withTransaction body bailed before reaching inserts
- both insert markers hit, library still empty → bug is **library-read-side**: UI either filters by a userId mismatch or fetches from a remote endpoint that 401s with our empty-bearer fake token

### Parallel infrastructure: logcat-bridge v1.1.0
The bridge can't read scoped external storage from PRoot, but the daemon runs as root. v1.1.0 (zip ready at `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/logcat-bridge-magisk.zip`, awaiting flash) adds `cat <path>`, `ls <path>`, and `sql <dbpath> <query>` verbs to the handler with allowlisted prefixes (`/data/data/`, `/data/local/tmp/`, `/data/tombstones/`, `/data/adb/modules/`, `/storage/emulated/0/Android/`, `/sdcard/Android/`) and `..` traversal blocked. `sqlite3` invoked with `-readonly -header`. Client side: `getlog --cat <path>`, `getlog --ls <path>`, `getlog --sql <dbpath> "SELECT ..."`. Once flashed + rebooted, this lets us inspect `GameLibraryDatabase` rows directly to confirm whether writes actually persist — covering the case where probes show inserts firing but UI still shows empty.

### Status awaiting user
- Flash logcat-bridge v1.1.0 zip + reboot.
- Install v0.1.1-600-test APK, reproduce Save, capture logs.
- Then I pull `getlog -n 20000 com.xiaoji.egggame` for probe markers AND `getlog --sql /data/data/com.xiaoji.egggame/databases/<gameLibraryDbName> "SELECT count(*) FROM game_library_base"` for the conclusive write-vs-read answer.

### Test 3 device-test result (2026-05-01, v0.1.1-600-test, run 25237940015)

All four probes fired in order, transaction body completed without CATCH:

```
19:59:41.063  GH600-DEBUG: xm7.u ENTRY
19:59:41.065  GH600-DEBUG: el7.invokeSuspend ENTRY
19:59:41.065  GH600-DEBUG: GameLaunchMethodDao.insert PRE
19:59:41.069  GH600-DEBUG: GameLibraryBaseDao.insert PRE
19:59:41.090  W App_Lifecycle: DISPOSE overlay=ye0      ← dialog dismisses
```

DB inspection (post-test) via `getlog --cat` + Python `sqlite3`:

- `egggame.db` — auth/UI DB (NOT GameLibraryDatabase). All tables empty as expected — login bypass means no auth_token / user_account row.
- **`db_game_library.db`** — actual GameLibraryDatabase, found via `et2.smali:584 const-string "db_game_library.db"`. Earlier listing missed it because the file is created lazily on first write.
  - `t_game_library_base` count = **1** (the imported row landed)
  - `t_game_launch_method` count = **1**
  - `t_game_install_state` count = 0
  - Imported row: `user_id='99999'`, `game_name='God of War'`, `id='local_DaebwST-TEyzp1KJX2xRzQ'`, `extension_data={"filePath":"/storage/emulated/0/Winlator/Games/GodOfWar/GoW.exe","steamAppid":"1593500"}`, `launch_method_id=1`. Write side **fully working**.

### Root cause of empty library UI (read-side, not write-side)

Library-list reader pipeline (smali trace, `wl7.smali` → `erc.smali:340`):

```
is0.e()                              ← StateFlow<f4m?> for current user account
  ↓
flatMapLatest { f4m ->
    if (f4m == null) emptyFlow()    ← TAKEN under our bypass
    else dao.subjectAllByUserId(f4m.a)
}
```

`is0` interface (smali_classes4/is0.smali):
- `d()Ld3k;` → Flow<l4m?> (auth token)
- `e()Ld3k;` → Flow<f4m?> (user account)        **← library reader uses this**
- `h()Ld3k;` → Flow<Boolean?> (is logged in)    **← we patched in v0.0.6**
- `f()Ll4m;` → `d().getValue()`                 **← we patched in v0.0.9**
- `b()Lf4m;` → `e().getValue()`

We patched `is0.f()` (l4m getter) and `os0.h()` (Boolean flow), but NOT `os0.e()` (f4m flow). With `t_user_account` empty (login bypassed), `os0.a` field's underlying StateFlow emits null, flatMapLatest drops to the empty branch, library list shows zero entries despite the row being in `t_game_library_base`.

### Fix planned for v0.1.2-600-test

**New extension** `extensions/gamehub/.../FakeUserAccount.java`:
- Reflectively constructs `Lf4m;` via `Class.forName("f4m").getDeclaredConstructor(...)` with sig
  `(String,String,String,String,String,String,I,I,Z,String,I,I,I,I,I,J,String,String,I,I,String,J,I,String,String,J,J)V`.
- Sets `a="99999"`, all other String fields `""`, all numerics zero.
- Caches in volatile static, logs to `GH600-DEBUG`. f4m's ctor null-checks `a` (p1) and `q` (p18); both pass.

**`BypassLoginPatch.kt` addition** (mirrors v0.0.6 `os0.h()` block):
```kotlin
firstMethod { definingClass == "Los0;" && name == "e" }.apply {
    removeInstruction(0) // iget-object p0, Los0;->a:Likh;
    removeInstruction(0) // return-object p0
    addInstructions(0, """
        invoke-static {}, Lapp/revanced/extension/gamehub/login/FakeUserAccount;->get()Ljava/lang/Object;
        move-result-object p0
        invoke-static {p0}, Lr8o;->r(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lf3k;
        move-result-object p0
        return-object p0
    """)
}
```

Debug probes intentionally **kept in place** (xm7.u ENTRY/CATCH, el7 ENTRY, both insert PRE markers, FakeAuthToken.get, DebugLogPatch) so the next device test can confirm `FakeUserAccount.get() called` fires before the UI populates and that the import flow is otherwise unchanged. Probes will be removed in a cleanup pass after the import flow is confirmed end-to-end.

## 2026-05-02 — v1.0.0-600 stable release session

### Goal
Ship the first stable BannerHub-API-enabled GameHub 6.0 release that pairs with the Worker's `/v6/` gate.

### Branch operations
- `bannerhub-api-patch` (commits `7644ad0` Redirect catalog API + `561b246` Prefix /v6) was fast-forward merged into `gamehub-600-build`. Branch kept (not deleted) per user instruction.
- `gamehub-537-build` deleted from local + `origin` (9 unique commits, all 5.3.7 work — the v6 CLI revert, settings menu disable for 5.3.7 R8 renames, target-APK swap, etc.). Abandoned 5.3.7 port; nothing reachable elsewhere.

### Stable release v1.0.0-600 (run 25264095270, commit 572ff30)
Triggered via `gh workflow run release.yml --ref gamehub-600-build -f tag=v1.0.0-600 -f stable=true`. Workflow opt-in `stable=true` checkbox produces the GitHub Release; default behavior is artifacts-only prerelease.

Title: **"Gamehub 6.0 - Bannerhub API - No Login - Muted UI"** (renamed in-place via `gh release edit` after the initial publish; workflow `name:` field also updated for future runs).

9 variant APKs + .rvp bundle + .rve extension files attached:
- Normal (`banner.hub`), Normal-GHL (`gamehub.lite`), PuBG (`com.tencent.ig`), AnTuTu (`com.antutu.ABenchMark`), alt-AnTuTu (`com.antutu.benchmark.full`), PuBG-CrossFire (`com.tencent.tmgp.cf`), Ludashi (`com.ludashi.aibench`), Genshin (`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`), Original (`com.xiaoji.egggame`).

### Release notes iterations (workflow body + live release body kept in sync via `gh release edit --notes-file`)
1. **Initial body was stale** — described only Bypass login + Disable Crashlytics + Debug logging + File manager + per-variant naming. Missing 3 patches that had landed since: Mute UI sounds (5ce470d, 2df0e54), Redirect catalog API (7644ad0), Prefix API path /v6 (561b246). Cancelled the in-flight run, updated `release.yml` body, retriggered. Run 25264031838 (cancelled) → 25264095270 (succeeded).
2. **Cross-release install warning added** — every CI run mints a new debug keystore (no `--keystore` passed to revanced-cli, ephemeral runner has empty workdir), so Android refuses cross-release upgrades with `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`. Replaced the wrong "To upgrade in place install the same variant" line with explicit uninstall-first instruction.
3. **Known limitations section added** with two callouts:
   - Steam launches via standard client are likely broken — use Lightweight Steam (`steam_client_0403`).
   - Imported games need cover art set manually.
4. **PC game settings orientation note added** — side benefit of the API redirect: per-game PC settings now renders in both landscape AND portrait (vanilla locked it to landscape only). Caused by the BannerHub Worker not carrying upstream's orientation constraint in the catalog response.

### README rewritten for v1.0.0-600 (commit 816dd2d, then b4cee47 for the orientation note)
Full doc rewrite covering all four user-facing patches (was stale, only described the No Login flow). Adds: cross-release fresh-install warning, Known Limitations section, per-patch sections for Mute UI sounds + Redirect catalog API + Prefix /v6, link to `bannerhub-api` repo as catalog backend, Releases section explaining stable-vs-prerelease workflow.

### Open follow-ups
- **Persistent keystore** — pin one in Actions secrets and pass `--keystore`/`--keystore-entry-alias`/`--keystore-password`/`--keystore-entry-password` on the revanced-cli patch command. Eliminates the cross-release uninstall requirement.
- **Bump versionCode per release** — patches don't currently touch versionCode; APKs ship with the base APK's value. Cosmetic only (Android allows install-replace with equal versionCode), but proper update-detection in package installers wants it bumped.
- **Component Manager port still pinned on `component-manager-injection`** at `5b89073`. Picker still doesn't show injected `Fex_2604`. Resume plan in memory unchanged: ship debug build with `Log.i("GH600-DEBUG", ...)` at top of every `HostCache.*` method, then in-foreground inject test.

## 2026-05-05 — Fix: per-variant DocumentsProvider authority

### Problem
v1.0.0-600 ships 9 variants that all declare the **same** DocumentsProvider authority, baked at the unrenamed `com.xiaoji.egggame.app.revanced.extension.gamehub.filemanager.MTDataFilesProvider`. Cause: `FileManagerAccessPatch` runs in the default `apply { ... }` block, which executes BEFORE `ChangePackageNamePatch`'s `afterDependents { ... }`, so it reads the original `manifest@package` value before the variant rename happens. The wake-up activity's `android:taskAffinity` (`com.xiaoji.egggame.MTDataFilesWakeUp`) is frozen the same way.

Practical impact: Android allows one app per provider authority globally. Installing a second variant alongside a first fails with `INSTALL_FAILED_CONFLICTING_PROVIDER`.

### Branch
`fix/file-manager-per-variant-authority` off `gamehub-600-build` (per branch-per-patch policy).

### Change
`patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/filemanager/FileManagerAccessPatch.kt`: `apply { ... }` → `afterDependents { ... }` (and `return@apply` → `return@afterDependents`). Patch body unchanged. Now reads `manifest@package` after `ChangePackageNamePatch` has rewritten it, so each variant gets:

- `<provider android:authorities="<variant-pkg>.app.revanced.extension.gamehub.filemanager.MTDataFilesProvider">`
- wake-up activity `android:taskAffinity="<variant-pkg>.MTDataFilesWakeUp"`

### Why this over `-O updateProviders=true`
- Single-file change vs workflow edit (and CLI option that has to be remembered on every future build).
- `updateProviders=true` only rewrites `<provider android:authorities>` — it does NOT touch `taskAffinity` on the wake-up activity, which would still collide across variants.
- `updateProviders=true` also rewrites authorities on **all** existing providers in the base APK (not just ours), which the option's own description warns can break features.

### Status
- CI compile green run 25379952428 (`build_pull_request.yml`).
- **Round 1** (commit 6d329bd, `apply{} → afterDependents{}`): release run 25382219259 success, but verifying APKs with `aapt dump xmltree | grep MTDataFiles` showed authority + taskAffinity STILL frozen at `com.xiaoji.egggame.*` for every variant. afterDependents alone wasn't sufficient.
- **Round 2** (commit 8f4a8fc, added `dependsOn(changePackageNamePatch)`): release run 25382742203 success, same negative result — patcher schedule still didn't put our manifest write after the rename.
- **Round 3 — verified working** (commit fadeaab, read `packageNameOption.value` directly): release run 25383226328 success. APKs now show per-variant authorities (`banner.hub.app.…MTDataFilesProvider`, `gamehub.lite.app.…MTDataFilesProvider`, …) and per-variant taskAffinities (`banner.hub.MTDataFilesWakeUp`, etc.). `Original` correctly stays at `com.xiaoji.egggame.*`. Branch ready to merge after device-side install test.

### Lesson
For revanced-patcher resource patches that need to react to "Change package name", do not rely on `afterDependents` + `dependsOn(changePackageNamePatch)` to read the post-rename `manifest@package` value — the scheduling guarantees aren't there. Instead, read `packageNameOption.value` directly (with a fallback to `packageNameOption.default`). The CLI option is set before any patch applies, so it's the only reliable source of the variant package within other patches.

### Round 4 — upstream literals also per-variant (commit f306a48)
After round 3 fixed MTDataFiles, manifest inspection of alt-AnTuTu showed pre-existing upstream literals still stuck at `com.xiaoji.egggame.*`:
- `<permission>`/`<uses-permission>` `com.xiaoji.egggame.DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION` — `signature` protectionLevel, would have blocked side-by-side install of variants with different signing certs
- 10 `<provider android:authorities="com.xiaoji.egggame.*">` declarations from MobProvider / fileprovider / FlyProvider / utilcode / firebaseinit / AndroidContext / androidx-startup / filekit / fileprovider / wbsdk — same authority, different package names → install conflict
- `<permission>` `com.xiaoji.egggame.permission.C2D_MESSAGE` — `normal` protectionLevel, NOT a blocker (Android allows multi-declaration of normal perms across apps)

Fix: added `-O 'updatePermissions=true'` and `-O 'updateProviders=true'` to the Change package name CLI invocation in `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Release run 25385421598 verified all 10 upstream provider authorities and the `signature` permission are now per-variant. C2D_MESSAGE intentionally untouched — `updatePermissions` only rewrites the hardcoded `DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION` per upstream patch source, and C2D_MESSAGE is harmless cosmetically.

### Final state for branch fix/file-manager-per-variant-authority
Verified APKs at `/storage/emulated/0/bannerhub-revanced-test-25385421598/`. All 9 variants now have fully decoupled manifests:
- `manifest@package` per-variant (existing)
- `DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION` per-variant (round 4)
- All 10 upstream provider authorities per-variant (round 4)
- MTDataFiles provider authority + wake-up taskAffinity per-variant (round 3)

Ready to merge into `gamehub-600-build` once device install test confirms two variants install alongside each other without `INSTALL_FAILED_CONFLICTING_PROVIDER`.

### Round 5 — C2D_MESSAGE permission per-variant (commit 91436af)
User reported the install dialog still said "package conflicts with a current package" when trying to install one variant alongside another, even on package names they didn't have installed. Re-audited all `com.xiaoji.egggame.*` literals in the alt-AnTuTu manifest from run 25385421598 — only one globally-unique identifier was still shared across variants:

```xml
<permission android:name="com.xiaoji.egggame.permission.C2D_MESSAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="com.xiaoji.egggame.permission.C2D_MESSAGE" />
```

This is the install blocker. Android 7+ rejects any install that declares a `<permission>` whose name another installed package already declares — regardless of `protectionLevel`, regardless of signing cert match. The package manager reports it as `INSTALL_FAILED_DUPLICATE_PERMISSION`, surfaced in the UI as the unhelpfully-vague "package conflicts with a current package" dialog. (Earlier I'd called this permission "harmless" on the grounds that `normal`-protection allows multi-declaration. That was wrong — the multi-declaration restriction was tightened to apply to all custom permissions in API 24, regardless of protection level.)

Other `com.xiaoji.egggame.*` literals in the manifest are NOT install blockers:
- `<activity android:name="...">` and `<service android:name="...">` — these are fully-qualified class names scoped to the app, not globally unique
- `taskAffinity="com.xiaoji.egggame"` — affinity is a task-grouping hint, not a unique system identifier; multiple apps can share it
- `<data android:scheme/host>` in intent-filters — multiple apps can register the same scheme

Fix: new `RewriteCustomPermissionsPatch` (resource patch, GameHub-specific). Iterates the manifest's `<permission>` and `<uses-permission>` elements; any element whose `android:name` starts with `com.xiaoji.egggame.permission.` gets the prefix rewritten to the variant package. Reads `packageNameOption.value` directly (same pattern as the MTDataFiles fix from round 3) — does not rely on patcher ordering against ChangePackageNamePatch. Confirmed via grep that no smali in the 6.0 decompile references `C2D_MESSAGE` literally, so renaming the manifest declaration doesn't break runtime broadcasts (the SDK either computes the name from `BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID` at runtime, or doesn't use the permission at all).

Release run 25387394484 verified: each of the 9 variants now declares its own per-variant `<permission android:name="<variantPkg>.permission.C2D_MESSAGE">`. APKs at `/storage/emulated/0/bannerhub-revanced-test-25387394484/`.

### How to actually test
1. Uninstall ALL previously-installed BannerHub-ReVanced variants from the device (including any v1.0.0-600 builds and any earlier test builds from this branch). They still declare `com.xiaoji.egggame.permission.C2D_MESSAGE` and will block fresh installs from run 25387394484.
2. Install Variant A (e.g. `Normal` = `banner.hub`).
3. Install Variant B (e.g. `PuBG` = `com.tencent.ig`) without uninstalling A.
4. Both should now coexist on the launcher. If step 3 still fails with the same "package conflicts with a current package" message, run `adb logcat -d | grep -iE 'install_failed|already declared'` immediately after the failed install and paste the output — there's another globally-unique declaration to track down.

## 2026-05-05 — v1.0.1-600 stable cut

### Branch operation
`fix/file-manager-per-variant-authority` (8 commits — 5 patch fixes + 3 progress-log updates) fast-forward merged into `gamehub-600-build` (commit range `7108634..2113683`). Branch deleted from local + origin. `gamehub-600-build` advanced from `7108634` → `2113683` → `220a204` (after the docs/release-notes prep commit).

### Stable release
Run **25389334422** (`gh workflow run release.yml --ref gamehub-600-build -f tag=v1.0.1-600 -f stable=true`) — all 10 jobs green (build + 9-variant patch matrix + Create GitHub Release). Published as https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/releases/tag/v1.0.1-600.

Title: **"Gamehub 6.0 - BannerHub API - Multi-Install"** (rebrand from v1.0.0-600's "Gamehub 6.0 - Bannerhub API - No Login - Muted UI" to highlight the headline fix).

### Release notes structure
1. Lead with the side-by-side install fix being the headline.
2. New `What's new vs v1.0.0-600` section explaining the three independent install-blockers stacked behind the single Android dialog (MTDataFiles authority + DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION + C2D_MESSAGE), each with its own root cause.
3. Migration warning: must uninstall **all** prior BannerHub-ReVanced variants — the legacy C2D_MESSAGE declaration on any single one of them blocks fresh installs from this release.
4. Full patch table updated to include the new `Rewrite custom permissions per variant` row and the per-variant `File manager access` callout.

### README
Bumped latest-stable line to v1.0.1-600 with the new title and link, added the "What's new" callouts and migration instruction, updated `File manager access` and `Change package name` patch sections, added new `Rewrite custom permissions per variant` section.

### Pre-release policy now in effect
Per `feedback_bannerhub_revanced_prerelease.md`, every workflow run from now on returns to artifact-only prerelease mode (no `stable=true`) until the user explicitly says "stable" again.

### Open follow-ups (unchanged from v1.0.0-600)
- Persistent keystore in Actions secrets so cross-release upgrades stop hitting `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`.
- Bump `versionCode` per release (cosmetic, but proper).
- Component Manager port resume — branch `component-manager-injection` still pinned at `5b89073`.

## 2026-05-07 — base APK bump to GameHub 6.0.1

### Goal
Verify existing patch bundle still applies cleanly against the new XiaoJi GameHub 6.0.1 base APK.

### What changed
- New base APK on hand: `GameHub_6.0.1.apk` — `com.xiaoji.egggame` versionCode `111` (was `110`), versionName `6.0.1`. Same signing cert (`gamesir`), same `targetSdkVersion=36`.
- Branch: `gamehub-601-build` cut from `gamehub-600-build` per branch-per-patch workflow.
- Commit `ab70d25`: `Constants.kt` `GAMEHUB_VERSION` `6.0.0` → `6.0.1`; `release.yml` source release `base-apk-600` → `base-apk-601` and asset/staged/CLI filenames `GameHub_beta_6.0.0_global.apk` / `GameHub_6.0.0.apk` → `GameHub_6.0.1.apk`. Variant output filenames left at `GameHub-6.0-Patched-*.apk` (version-agnostic enough for now).
- New release `base-apk-601` created with `GameHub_6.0.1.apk` (133 MB) attached.

### Result — CI run [25517417367](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25517417367)
**All 9 variants green** in ~3 min. No fingerprint or smali repair needed; every patch (BypassLogin, DisableCrashlytics, DebugLog, FileManagerAccess, RewriteCustomPermissions, MuteUiSounds, RedirectCatalogApi, PrefixApiPath, ChangePackageName, ChangeAppName) still applies untouched against versionCode 111.

### Implication
6.0.1 is a minor base bump only — no fingerprint targets moved. `gamehub-601-build` is shippable as-is once release notes are written; release-body text + variant output filenames in `release.yml` should be updated before the first stable v1.0.0-601 cut, but those are cosmetic, not functional.

### Next
- Device-test one variant (likely Original) installed alongside or replacing v1.0.1-600.
- If install + login-bypass + import flow OK, draft v1.0.0-601 release notes (or v1.0.2-600 if we treat as a refresh).
- Decide whether to merge `gamehub-601-build` → `gamehub-600-build` after stable, or keep them parallel.

## 2026-05-07 — v1.0.0-601 stable shipped

### Tag
[`v1.0.0-601`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/releases/tag/v1.0.0-601) — "Gamehub 6.0.1 - BannerHub API - Multi-Install" — 9 APKs + `.rvp` bundle + `.rve` extensions

### Build
- Branch: `gamehub-601-build` (kept separate from `gamehub-600-build` per user direction; not merged back)
- Final commit on branch: `990e30e` (release prep — release.yml/README rewrites)
- Stable CI run: [25518201750](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25518201750), all 9 variants green, release job published successfully

### What shipped
- Base APK: `GameHub_6.0.1.apk` (versionCode 111) from `base-apk-601` release
- Same 9 patches as v1.0.1-600 — bypass login, disable Crashlytics, debug logging, file manager (per-variant), rewrite custom permissions (per-variant), mute UI sounds, redirect catalog API, prefix /v6/, change package name (per-variant), change app name (per-variant)
- Functional delta from v1.0.1-600: zero. This is a base APK refresh only.
- Variant filenames bumped from `GameHub-6.0-Patched-*.apk` to `GameHub-6.0.1-Patched-*.apk` so users can tell which base version they're running.

### Awaiting
- Device test of any v1.0.0-601 variant. v1.0.0-601 should be drop-in compatible with v1.0.1-600 device test results; only base APK changed.

## 2026-05-07 — v1.0.0-601 BROKEN: BypassLoginPatch is a no-op on 6.0.1

### Symptom
Device test of v1.0.0-601 (Original variant, `com.xiaoji.egggame`): app launches, opening game library shows the login wall. Logcat captured 7× `SHOW_SOFT_INPUT_BY_INSETS_API` consistent with login-form text fields gaining focus.

### Diagnosis (proven)
**All four targets in `BypassLoginPatch.kt` silently no-op'd against 6.0.1.** R8 in 6.0.1 renumbered class letters; the patch's hardcoded `Los0;`/`Lxm7;`/`Lis0;`/`Lg8e;` literals still resolve to *some* class in 6.0.1, but those classes have completely different roles:

| Class | 6.0.0 role | 6.0.1 reality |
|---|---|---|
| `Los0;` | DB-backed auth session impl with `h()`/`e()` StateFlow getters | Tiny `Flow.emit` operator wrapper — only `<init>` + `emit()` |
| `Lxm7;` | `GameLibraryRepository.f()` returning userId | A `Lbf3;` SuspendLambda — only `<init>` + `invokeSuspend` |
| `Lis0;` | Auth interface with default `f()` returning `Ll4m;` | The **actual** auth/user repository now (has `UserDao` + `AuthTokenDao` fields); `f()` is `(String, Continuation)→Object` — wrong signature |
| `Lg8e;` | Navigator class with `i(rh0)`/`r(rh0)` Login gates | Kotlin lambda factory `<init>` + `invoke()` only |

**Hard proof:**
- `os0.smali` MD5 identical between base 6.0.1 and patched 6.0.1: `50bb1fc9ea86ab180234aed6fe1e1cd4`
- `FakeAuthToken`/`FakeUserAccount` extension classes ARE bundled in the patched APK (`smali_classes7/app/revanced/extension/gamehub/login/`) but **no smali outside DebugTrace string literal calls them** — the patch never injected the calls.
- CI run 25517417367 + stable run 25518201750 both passed because patcher v22's `firstMethod { ... }` is lenient — when no method matches, it silently no-ops. The "all 9 variants green" was a false positive on 6.0.1.

### Artifacts available on resume
- 6.0.1 base APK decompile: `/tmp/gh601_smali/` (apktool, --no-res)
- 6.0.1 patched APK decompile: `/tmp/gh601_patched_smali/`
- Logcat from device repro: `/home/claude-user/logcat-com.xiaoji.egggame-20260507-170151.txt`
- 6.0.0 (working) decompile may need to be regenerated: `~/GameHub_beta_6.0.0_global.apk` is on disk
- Patch source: `bannerhub-revanced/patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/misc/login/BypassLoginPatch.kt`

### Chosen fix path: Option A — string-literal refingerprinting
User picked re-fingerprinting with stable anchors (vs. quick-fix hardcoding new 6.0.1 letters) so the patch survives future minor versions (6.0.2, 6.0.3, …).

### What "string-literal refingerprinting" means here
Instead of `definingClass == "Los0;" && name == "h"`, anchor on things R8 *can't* mangle:
- **String literals** the class references (e.g., SharedPreferences keys like `"auth_token"`, screen route names like `"login"`/`"home"`, error messages)
- **DAO/Entity types** at instance-field level (`com.xiaoji.egggame.core.database.dao.UserDao`, `AuthTokenDao` — these names are stable, kept by R8 keep-rules)
- **Return-type shape** (e.g., method returning `Lf3k;` or kotlinx StateFlow)
- **Method-call sequences** (e.g., a method that calls both `UserDao.observeCurrent()` and `AuthTokenDao.observeCurrent()` is the auth-state combiner)

Concrete fingerprint targets to find in 6.0.1:
1. **Auth-session class** — has `UserDao` + `AuthTokenDao` instance fields; in 6.0.1 this is `Lis0;` (verified). Find via field-type fingerprint, not class name.
2. **isLoggedIn StateFlow getter** — method on the auth class returning `Lf3k;`/StateFlow over `Ljava/lang/Boolean;`. Find via return-type + a string-literal anchor.
3. **User-account StateFlow getter** — method returning StateFlow over the user entity (likely `Lcom/xiaoji/egggame/core/database/entity/UserEntity;` based on 6.0.1 smali).
4. **Auth token getter** — method returning the token wrapper class (was `Ll4m;` in 6.0.0 — verify shape in 6.0.1; probably renamed).
5. **GameLibraryRepository userId getter** — method returning `Ljava/lang/String;` keyed off the auth token.
6. **Navigator gate** — method that contains both `iget Lis0;->...` (or its 6.0.1 equiv) AND a string literal "login"/"home" in proximity. The instruction-pattern match (iget+invoke-interface+if-nez+new-instance) is what we re-anchor on.

### Resume checklist
1. Re-decompile current 6.0.0 base APK (`~/GameHub_beta_6.0.0_global.apk`) to confirm what role each renamed class held → use as cross-reference for what semantics we're trying to match in 6.0.1.
2. Find the auth-session class in 6.0.1 by field-type fingerprint (UserDao + AuthTokenDao). Confirmed candidate: `Lis0;`.
3. For each of the 6 targets above, write a fingerprint that resolves to the right method in 6.0.1.
4. Update `BypassLoginPatch.kt` to use ReVanced patcher's `MethodFingerprint` API instead of literal `definingClass ==` checks.
5. Add a runtime sanity log inside the patched method (one Log.i per gate fires) so future device tests immediately tell us if the patch ran.
6. Build, deploy, device-test on Original variant. Pull logcat and confirm the new sentinel logs fire AND the library opens without login.
7. Cut a v1.0.0-601 hotfix (probably v1.0.1-601) once verified.

### Decision parking lot
- v1.0.0-601 release is BROKEN (all installs hit login wall). Did not roll it back per user direction (we'll fix forward).
- 5.x stable v1.0.1-600 (gamehub-600-build) is unaffected — those patches still work against the 6.0.0 base.

## 2026-05-07 (cont.) — BypassLoginPatch rewritten for 6.0.1

### Mapping derived from base APK decompile
| 6.0.0 letter | 6.0.1 letter | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `Los0;` | `Lrs0;` | Auth-session impl (3 StateFlow fields, UserDao+AuthTokenDao ctor) |
| `Lis0;` | `Lls0;` | Auth-session interface (`a/b/c/d/e/f/g/h` methods) |
| `Lxm7;` | `Lhp7;` | GameLibraryRepository (`b:AUTH_INTERFACE` field, `f()String`) |
| `Lg8e;` | `Lade;` | Navigator (`b:AUTH_INTERFACE` field, `i(Lph0;)V` + `r(Lph0;)V` gates) |
| `Lga0;` | `Lca0;` | Login navigation intent (referenced from gates; not patched directly) |
| `Lrh0;` | `Lph0;` | Navigator i/r param type |
| `Ll4m;` | `Lfdm;` | Auth token wrapper (10-field data class, identical shape) |
| `Lf4m;` | `Ladm;` | User account (27-field data class, identical shape) |
| `Lf3k;` | `Lr8k;` | StateFlow read interface |
| `Lr8o;->r(Object)Lf3k;` | `Lumn;->h(Object)Lt8k;` | MutableStateFlow factory |

### What changed in code (commit pending)
- **`BypassLoginPatch.kt`**: full rewrite with all class letters extracted to a single named const block at top, accompanied by structural anchors (decompile recipes) for each. Patch body unchanged in semantics — same six targets — just sourcing names from the const block. Verified `Lt8k;` IS-A `Lr8k;` via `Lx6e;` so the synthetic flow returned from `rs0.h/e` type-checks against the declared return type.
- **NEW patch on `Lar0;->a(...)`**: 6.0.1 introduced a separate NavigationInterceptor (`getOrder()==10`, `Llxb;` interface) that gates on `Lls0;->a()Z` independently of the navigator. Same iget+invoke-interface+if-nez+new-instance pattern as `ade.i/r`; bypassed identically with `const/4 vN, 0x1`.
- **`FakeAuthToken.java`**: `Class.forName("l4m")` → `Class.forName("fdm")`, hoisted to `AUTH_TOKEN_CLASS` const for one-line bumps next time. Same 10-arg ctor (verified shape identical between `Ll4m;` and `Lfdm;`).
- **`FakeUserAccount.java`**: `Class.forName("f4m")` → `Class.forName("adm")`, hoisted to `USER_ACCOUNT_CLASS` const. Same 27-arg ctor (verified shape identical).
- **No inline `Log.i` sentinels** in the patched method bodies: `rs0.h/e` and `ls0.f` are `.locals 0`, can't accommodate two free registers without growing locals (which patcher v22's `addInstructions` doesn't auto-do). Sentinel signal is provided by the existing `DebugTrace.write` calls inside `FakeAuthToken.get()` and `FakeUserAccount.get()` — the next device test's logcat will show "FakeAuthToken.get() called" / "FakeUserAccount.get() called" lines tagged GH600-DEBUG, which only fire if the `ls0.f()` / `rs0.e()` patches landed.

### Why this still requires letter updates next minor version
Even with the const block, the letters `Lrs0;`/`Lls0;`/`Lhp7;`/`Lade;`/`Lar0;`/`Lumn;`/`Lt8k;`/`Lfdm;`/`Ladm;` will all rotate again on the next R8 build. The improvement vs. the original patch is:
- All letters are in ONE place (const block + 2 Java strings), so re-deriving a new mapping is a 9-string PR instead of a 4-file scavenger hunt.
- Each const has a structural anchor comment so the resolver recipe is recorded.
- True version-independence (no manual updates ever) would require resolving classes by structural fingerprint at patch time. Deferred — that's a bigger refactor and the const-block approach is sufficient for the 6.0.x series.

### Next: CI prerelease + device test
Trigger Release workflow (no `stable=true`) on `gamehub-601-build`. Pull artifact APK, install Original variant, repro library tap. Logcat must show:
- `GH600-DEBUG: FakeAuthToken.get() called`  → `ls0.f()` patch fired
- `GH600-DEBUG: FakeUserAccount.get() called` → `rs0.e()` patch fired
- Library opens without login wall → `rs0.h()` + navigator + interceptor patches all working

## 2026-05-07 (cont. 2) — API redirect patches also broken on 6.0.1

### Symptom
Device test of bypass-fix prerelease: login bypass + mute UI work, but BannerHub catalog API redirect doesn't take effect. App still hits upstream landscape-api.vgabc.com instead of the Worker.

### Diagnosis
Same R8 letter-shuffle pattern as BypassLoginPatch. Verified by inspecting prerelease patched APK: `zhj.smali` (the new Environment enum) still contains `"landscape-api-cn.vgabc.com"` and `"landscape-api-oversea.vgabc.com"` literals — `RedirectCatalogApiPatch.kt` silently no-op'd because it's hunting `Lmcj;` which is a different class in 6.0.1.

### Mapping
| 6.0.0 | 6.0.1 | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `Lmcj;` | `Lzhj;` | Catalog Environment enum (Online/Beta/Test); contains the host string literals |
| `Lzdb;` | `Lohb;` | Static URL-path helper (Ktor pipeline) |
| `Lqx9;` | `Lj1a;` | URL builder param type (Ktor HttpRequestBuilder.url) |
| `Lm1l;->t1` | `Lu9l;->s1` | String trim helper (referenced inside the body, not patched directly) |

### Fix
- **`RedirectCatalogApiPatch.kt`**: `MCJ_CLASS = "Lmcj;"` → `ENV_ENUM_CLASS = "Lzhj;"` with structural anchor comment ("the unique class containing both `landscape-api-cn.vgabc.com` and `landscape-api-oversea.vgabc.com`"). String literals are R8-stable so the anchor survives future minor versions; only the ONE letter `Lzhj;` needs updating per bump (or could be auto-derived).
- **`PrefixApiPathPatch.kt`**: `ZDB_CLASS = "Lzdb;"` → `URL_HELPER_CLASS = "Lohb;"`, plus new `URL_BUILDER_TYPE = "Lj1a;"` const replacing the hardcoded `"Lqx9;"` in the parameterTypes match. Body shape is byte-stable across versions; the anchor comment records the structural recipe (static method `(LBuilder;String)V` whose body starts iget-object from the builder's URL field then calls a string-trim helper).

### Re-verify after this fix
After CI: pull the new artifact, decompile, confirm `zhj.smali` now shows `"bannerhub-api.the412banner.workers.dev"` in BOTH host slots; confirm `ohb.b(Lj1a;String)V` opens with `invoke-static {p1}, V6PathPrefix->prefix(...)`.

## 2026-05-07 (cont. 3) — Device test ALL GREEN; cutting v1.0.1-601 hotfix

User confirmed prerelease build (run 25526407710, commit 3f81890) on Original variant: login bypassed, library opens, BannerHub catalog API redirect working, mute UI working. All 9 patches now actually applying as intended on 6.0.1.

### Cut as v1.0.1-601 stable
- Tag: v1.0.1-601
- Title: "Gamehub 6.0.1 - BannerHub API - Multi-Install" (same as v1.0.0-601)
- release.yml body rewritten with "Hotfix vs v1.0.0-601" section explaining the 3 patches that no-op'd and now don't
- README "Latest stable" pointer + What's-new block updated; broken-build warning added at the top

## 2026-05-07 (cont. 4) — v1.0.1-601 SHIPPED + cleanup

### Live release
[`v1.0.1-601` — Gamehub 6.0.1 - BannerHub API - Multi-Install](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/releases/tag/v1.0.1-601). 9 APKs + .rvp bundle + .rve extensions. CI run 25526848503, branch head `9ea01d4`.

### Cleanup
- Deleted v1.0.0-601 release entirely (was already de-listed; tag also removed from origin + local).
- v1.0.1-601 is now Latest.
- Memory file `project_bypass_login_601_refingerprint.md` deleted (obsolete now that the fix shipped).
- Memory `project_bannerhub_revanced.md` updated: gamehub-601-build entry rewritten, "Active next step" block rewritten to reflect shipped state, MEMORY.md index entry updated.

### What we know works on 6.0.1 (per device test of prerelease run 25526407710)
1. ✅ Bypass login (rs0.h/e + ls0.f + hp7.f + ade.i/r + ar0.a)
2. ✅ Redirect catalog API (zhj Online enum hosts → Worker)
3. ✅ Prefix API path with /v6 (ohb.b inserts V6PathPrefix call)
4. ✅ Mute UI sounds
5. (untested but applied per CI) Disable Crashlytics, Debug logging, File manager, Rewrite custom permissions, Change package name, Change app name

### Known follow-up
None blocking. Possible future work: migrate the const-block letter mapping to true MethodFingerprint-based auto-discovery so future minor-version bumps don't require any source edits at all. Deferred — current setup is good enough for the 6.0.x series.

## 2026-05-07 — vjoy cloud-share Worker proxy (cross-repo) + docs

User reported the new 6.0.1 cloud-share vjoy/Scheme screen still showed "log in first" even with bypass-login active. Diagnosed via temporary KV-debug intercept on the Worker: the 401 is server-side (upstream rejects unauthenticated requests on `vcontroller/recommendMapList`); the client sends GETs with `clientparams`/`sign`/`time` headers but no token at all. Existing Worker fall-through stripped all original headers and never injected a token, so upstream got an anonymous request → 401 → "Please login first".

Fixed in `bannerhub-api` repo (commit `0792400` on master + main): new dedicated handler covering `vcontroller/*`, `simulator/{configList,getConfigById,shareConfig,deleteShareConfig,reportConfigApply}`, `readLayoutType/*`, `writeLayoutType/*`. Forwards original request headers verbatim, drops only hop-by-hop and CF-injected ones, injects `token: <bannerhub_token>` from KV, and recomputes `sign` for POST bodies that contain a token field. Verified live → device-confirmed: full upstream catalog visible (GTA5专用按键, Gamehub 2, etc.). Side-effect: every BannerHub user authenticates as the same shared `bannerhub_token` user — acceptable for now.

### Documentation updates
- `gamehub_reports/GAMEHUB_600_MASTER_MAP.md` — added § 26 (6.0.0 → 6.0.1 deltas) covering APK identity bump, full R8 letter-remap table with structural anchors, new vjoy/Scheme cloud-share subsystem (NavKeys, data model, repository, ViewModel, on-device storage), new API endpoint family, new `Lar0;` NavigationInterceptor, firmware 1.3.4 → 1.3.5, upstream feature highlights. Map grew 2556 → 2702 lines.
- `gamehub_reports/BANNERHUB_API_6.0_INTEGRATION.md` — added § 14 (2026-05-07 6.0.1 changes) covering v1.0.1-601 hotfix, R8 letter remap, firmware bump, new endpoint family, captured request-shape table, Worker proxy implementation, verification, files-touched manifest.
- Memory: `project_gamehub_600_master_map.md`, `project_bannerhub_api_60_integration_report.md`, `project_bannerhub_api_worker.md`, `MEMORY.md` index — all updated to reflect the new sections + line counts + the "on the next 6.0.x bump" instructions for re-deriving R8 letters via structural anchors.

## 2026-05-10 — gamehub-602-build (GameHub 6.0.2 base bump)

### Goal
Bump base from GameHub 6.0.1 (versionCode 111) to 6.0.2 (versionCode 112). Re-anchor every bytecode patch against the new R8 letter map, mirror what we did for the 6.0.0 → 6.0.1 jump.

### Branch + base APK
- Branch: `gamehub-602-build`, forked from `gamehub-601-build` head (`9ea01d4`).
- Base APK: `GameHub_6.0.2.apk` (135 MB, package `com.xiaoji.egggame`, versionCode 112).
- Hosted as release tag [`base-apk-602`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/releases/tag/base-apk-602) (target = `gamehub-602-build`). Workflow downloads from there during patch-build.
- Decompile: `apktool d --no-res` against the 6.0.2 APK lands in `/tmp/gh602_smali/` across `smali/`, `smali_classes2/` … `smali_classes6/` (6 dex shards, up from 5 on 6.0.1). r8-map-id `032c299c671f291b037da144c04f4b9bdf25a0ddc75c43b14ff2382d5f50d1fa` is the unique build identifier — every smali file's `.source` line carries it, useful as a single-grep verification that the decompile is actually 6.0.2 and not a 6.0.1 leftover.

### Fingerprint verification — every single bytecode anchor moved

Same situation as 6.0.0 → 6.0.1: a sweeping R8 letter reshuffle. None of the 6.0.1 letter classes still hold the same shape in 6.0.2 (some keep their letter but the body is now an unrelated coroutine continuation). New mappings derived via the structural-anchor recipes recorded in each patch source:

| Patch | Anchor | 6.0.1 | 6.0.2 | How re-derived |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BypassLogin | AUTH_IMPL | `Lrs0;` | `Lit0;` | Class with ctor `(UserDao, AuthTokenDao, Lu70;)V` + 3 same-type StateFlow fields |
| BypassLogin | AUTH_INTERFACE | `Lls0;` | `Lct0;` | `.implements` line on AUTH_IMPL — interface with abstract `d/e/h()Lrjk;` |
| BypassLogin | AUTH_TOKEN | `Lfdm;` | `Lkpm;` | 10-field data class returned by `ct0.f()`; ctor sig `(S,S,S,S,Long,Long,J,Z,J,J)V` matches exactly |
| BypassLogin | GAME_LIB_REPO | `Lhp7;` | `Luu7;` | Class with `b:Lct0;` field + ctor `(GameLibraryDatabase, Lct0;)V`. ⚠ userId getter renamed `f()` → `e()` between 6.0.1 and 6.0.2 — patch updated to filter by `parameterTypes.isEmpty() && returnType == "Ljava/lang/String;"` to avoid matching unrelated overloads |
| BypassLogin | NAVIGATOR | `Lade;` | `Lxle;` | Class with `b:Lct0;` field + `i(Lgi0;)V` and `r(Lgi0;)V` methods that contain the `iget b:ct0` + `invoke-interface ct0->a()Z` + `new-instance Lsa0;` (Login intent — was Lca0; in 6.0.1) gate pattern at xle.i:270 / xle.r:79 |
| BypassLogin | NAV_INTERCEPTOR | `Lar0;` | `Lrr0;` | Class with `<init>(Lct0;)V` ctor + `a(Lp4c;Ls2c;Lzh3;)Object` that calls `ct0.a()Z` then builds `Lo5c;` redirect |
| RedirectCatalogApi | ENV_ENUM_CLASS | `Lzhj;` | `Lxrj;` | Unique class containing both `landscape-api-cn.vgabc.com` and `landscape-api-oversea.vgabc.com` string literals (in xrj's `<clinit>` at lines 41/45) |
| PrefixApiPath | URL_HELPER_CLASS | `Lohb;` | `Lvob;` | Static method `b(L<short>;Ljava/lang/String;)V` whose body starts with `iget-object` from the builder's URL field then `Lpll;->s1(CharSequence)CharSequence` trim |
| PrefixApiPath | URL_BUILDER_TYPE | `Lj1a;` | `Lm7a;` | First param of vob.b — the Ktor URLBuilder analog |
| DebugLog | y2d-impl | `Lodb;` | `Li86;` | Concrete class implementing `pgd.e(Throwable, Lmw6;)V` whose body delegates to `pgd.e` then writes to a sink |
| DebugLog | save method | `Lxm7;->u` | `Luu7;->v` | 3-arg `(GameInfo, LaunchMethod, Continuation)` method on uu7 that calls `pgd.e` in catch (line 322) |
| DebugLog | retro upsert wrapper | `Ly4i;->b` | `Lyji;->b` | Single class referencing `RetroGameDao;->upsert` (yji.smali:97) |
| DebugLog | y2d-interface | `Ly2d;` | `Lpgd;` | Abstract method `e(Ljava/lang/Throwable;Lmw6;)V` (`Lmw6;` is the Function0 type) |
| DebugLog | inner Room txn | `Lel7;` | `Lvs7;` | Continuation class with `invokeSuspend.locals 70` (closest to original `el7` `.locals 69`) and both `GameLaunchMethodDao.insert` + `GameLibraryBaseDao.insert` |

Patches keyed on full Android / Firebase / asset-path / manifest names — Disable Crashlytics (anchored on `Lcom/xiaoji/egggame/BaseAndroidApp;->onCreate` + `FirebaseCrashlytics->getInstance` / `setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled`), Mute UI sounds (asset path `assets/composeResources/com.xiaoji.egggame.core/files/sound`), File manager access (manifest), Rewrite custom permissions (manifest), Change package name / Change app name (revanced built-ins) — apply byte-for-byte without any source change.

### MutableStateFlow factory surgery

The 6.0.0 / 6.0.1 patch could call `Lumn;->h(Object)Lt8k;` inline — a one-arg StateFlow factory whose return type was directly assignable to `AUTH_INTERFACE.h()` / `.e()`'s declared return type. In 6.0.2 the only one-arg factory is `Ltwo;->l(Object)Ltjk;`, and `Ltjk;` does NOT implement the abstract StateFlow interface (`Lrjk;`) that `h()`/`e()` declare; the host wraps it in `Lhzh;` (which DOES implement Lrjk;) before exposing it via `Leuo;->e0` (stateIn).

Doing the same wrap inline from smali would require growing the patched method's `.locals` from 0 to 2 (need scratch registers for the inner Ltjk; instance and the outer Lhzh; instance). To avoid that, added a `FakeStateFlow` Java extension that does the wrap via reflection (`Class.forName("tjk")` → `<init>(Object)` → `Class.forName("hzh")` → `<init>(vfe)` where `Class.forName("vfe")` is the Lhzh; ctor's interface arg). Both factories cached after first build. Smali edit stays a single `invoke-static`:

```smali
invoke-static {}, FakeStateFlow->boolTrue()Ljava/lang/Object;
move-result-object p0
return-object p0
```

Updated FakeAuthToken (`adm` → `kpm`) and FakeUserAccount (`fdm` → `fpm`) extension class refs. `FakeUserAccount`'s 27-arg ctor signature stayed byte-identical between 6.0.1 and 6.0.2.

### Workflow + release notes
`.github/workflows/release.yml` rewritten for 6.0.2: base APK download tag, all 9 variant filenames (`GameHub-6.0.2-Patched-*.apk`), release name + body. Release narrative documents the 6.0.1 → 6.0.2 letter remap so future readers don't have to guess.

### CI verification
First test build kicked off as run [`25619647877`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25619647877) on `gamehub-602-build` via `gh workflow run release.yml --ref gamehub-602-build -f tag=v0.1.0-602-test` (artifact-only prerelease — not a stable cut). Watching for green; if patches build cleanly the next step is device-test the 9 APKs to confirm bypass-login + catalog-redirect + /v6 prefix all fire end-to-end.

### CI verification result
Run [`25619647877`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25619647877) **green in 2m49s** (started 04:20:19 UTC, finished 04:23:08 UTC):
- ✅ Build patches bundle
- ✅ Patch Normal / Normal-GHL / PuBG / AnTuTu / alt-AnTuTu / PuBG-CrossFire / Ludashi / Genshin / Original (all 9)
- ⏭ Create GitHub Release (intentionally skipped — `stable=false` on this test run)

Every re-anchored fingerprint matched at patcher time. All 9 APK artifacts (~111 MB each) on the run, 14-day retention. **Next step: device test** — install the `Original` artifact (or any of the variants) and confirm bypass-login + catalog redirect + /v6 prefix all fire on 6.0.2 the same as they did on 6.0.1, then cut a stable release.

### Stable release — v1.0.0-602 (2026-05-10 14:59 UTC)

[`v1.0.0-602` — Gamehub 6.0.2 - BannerHub API - Patched](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/releases/tag/v1.0.0-602) is live. Stable cut as run [`25631854018`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25631854018) — all 9 variant patch jobs succeeded plus the `release` job (`stable=true`), 12 assets attached: the 9 patched APKs + the `.rvp` patch bundle + the 2 `.rve` extension files. Device-tested by user before stable cut. Release notes ship the 6.0.1 → 6.0.2 R8 letter remap table and the `FakeStateFlow` rationale verbatim.

This is the first stable on the `gamehub-602-build` branch and the first one in the project's history that didn't require a `.0` → `.1` hotfix because the structural-anchor recipes recorded after the 6.0.0 → 6.0.1 fiasco let every fingerprint be re-derived correctly on the first try. README updated to reflect 6.0.2 as the latest stable; v1.0.1-601 / v1.0.0-601 / v1.0.1-600 sections moved into "historical" sections at the top.

## 6.0.4 base port — 2026-05-12

### Setup

User requested 6.0.4 base bump from 6.0.2 stable. `GameHub_6.0.4.apk` (versionCode 114, versionName 6.0.4) staged from Downloads → home → released as `base-apk-604`. Decompile to `/tmp/gh604_smali` with the standard recipe. New branch `gamehub-604-build` cut off `gamehub-602-build` head `abf1eac` per the branch-per-patch rule.

### R8 letter delta (6.0.2 → 6.0.4)

R8 map id `6a5cde6143fc8cf76f6f3a447d0fececd4794d83066e6ead7a9537e6527b057b` (vs 6.0.2's `032c299c…`). Every anchor reshuffled again. Full per-anchor verification + structural-recipe trace lives in `gamehub_reports/GH604_LETTER_MAP.md`.

| Patch | Anchor | 6.0.2 | 6.0.4 | Structural verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BypassLogin | AUTH_IMPL | `Lit0;` | `Ljt0;` | 3× `Lozh;` fields, ctor `(UserDao, AuthTokenDao, Lv70;)V`, implements `Ldt0;` |
| BypassLogin | AUTH_INTERFACE | `Lct0;` | `Ldt0;` | Abstract `d/e/h()Lyjk;` + `f()Lwpm;` + `b()Lrpm;` |
| BypassLogin | AUTH_TOKEN | `Lkpm;` | `Lwpm;` | 10-field data class returned by `dt0.f()`, ctor sig `(S,S,S,S,Long,Long,J,Z,J,J)V` matches exactly |
| BypassLogin | GAME_LIB_REPO | `Luu7;` | `Lvu7;` | Class with `b:Ldt0;` field + ctor `(GameLibraryDatabase, Ldt0;)V`. User-id getter still `e()` |
| BypassLogin | NAVIGATOR | `Lxle;` | `Lgme;` | `b:Ldt0;` field + `i(Lhi0;)V` and `r(Lhi0;)V` methods carrying iget+invoke+if-nez+new-instance `Lta0;` (Login intent — was `Lsa0;` in 6.0.2) |
| BypassLogin | NAV_INTERCEPTOR | `Lrr0;` | **`Liod;` (skipped)** | Inline auth check moved into coroutine continuation `Lhod;->invokeSuspend` (lines 255/259/267). Apply block commented out; option C TODO recorded for later |
| RedirectCatalogApi | ENV_ENUM_CLASS | `Lxrj;` | `Lesj;` | Unique class containing both `landscape-api-cn.vgabc.com` + `landscape-api-oversea.vgabc.com` |
| PrefixApiPath | URL_HELPER_CLASS | `Lvob;` | `Lcpb;` | Static `b(Ln7a;Ljava/lang/String;)V` body: iget URL field → invoke trim → toString → length |
| PrefixApiPath | URL_BUILDER_TYPE | `Lm7a;` | `Ln7a;` | First param of cpb.b; field `a:Lokm;` (Ktor builder shape preserved). Trim helper moved from `Lpll;->s1` to `Lbml;->s1` (patch doesn't reference it directly) |
| DebugLog | y2d-impl | `Li86;` | `Lj86;` | Concrete class with `e(Throwable, Lnw6;)V` delegating to `Lxgd;->e` |
| DebugLog | y2d-interface | `Lpgd;` | `Lxgd;` | Abstract `e(Throwable, Lnw6;)V` + 9 other methods. `Lnw6;` is the Function0 type (was `Lmw6;`) |
| DebugLog | save method | `Luu7;->v` | `Lvu7;->v` | Same method name; new owning class follows GAME_LIB_REPO |
| DebugLog | retro upsert wrapper | `Lyji;->b` | `Lfki;->b` | Single field `a:RetroGameDao`, method `b(RetroGameEntity, Ci3)Object` is the only meaningful upsert wrapper |
| DebugLog | inner Room txn | `Lvs7;` | `Lws7;` | `.locals 70`, calls both `GameLaunchMethodDao;->insert` and `GameLibraryBaseDao;->insert` |
| OfflineComponentCache | ECI_CLASS | `Leci;` | `Lmci;` | `a(RepoCategory, Lci3;)Ljava/io/Serializable;` — unique match in dex tree |
| OfflineComponentCache | CONTINUATION_TYPE | `Lai3;` | `Lci3;` | Inferred from mci.a's second parameter |
| OfflineComponentCache | KOTLIN_EMPTY_LIST_CLASS | `Lz85;` | `Lw85;` | `implements List, Serializable, RandomAccess` (kotlin.collections.EmptyList) — sget'd at `:goto_2` in mci.a |
| FakeAuthToken ext | AUTH_TOKEN_CLASS | `kpm` | `wpm` | Same as BypassLogin AUTH_TOKEN |
| FakeUserAccount ext | USER_ACCOUNT_CLASS | `fpm` | `rpm` | 27-field class matching reflective 27-arg ctor lookup; `dt0.b()` returns `Lrpm;` |
| FakeStateFlow ext | STATE_FLOW_IMPL_CLASS | `tjk` | `akk` | `<init>(Object)V`, implements `Ldge;` (the holder iface) |
| FakeStateFlow ext | STATE_FLOW_WRAPPER_CLASS | `hzh` | `ozh` | `<init>(Ldge;)V`, implements `Lyjk;` (the abstract StateFlow interface) |
| FakeStateFlow ext | STATE_FLOW_HOLDER_INTERFACE | `vfe` | `dge` | Inferred from ozh ctor + akk `.implements` |

Patches unchanged (no R8-renamed anchors): Disable Crashlytics, Mute UI sounds, File manager access, Rewrite custom permissions, Change package/app name. Constants.GAMEHUB_VERSION bumped `6.0.2` → `6.0.4`.

### NAV_INTERCEPTOR architectural change (the "fingerprint problem")

In 6.0.0–6.0.2 the NAV_INTERCEPTOR's `a(...)` method body held the auth check inline — patch hooked on `iget AUTH_INTERFACE` + `invoke-interface a()Z` + `if-nez` + `new-instance Lredirect;`. In 6.0.4 `Liod;->a(Lrdb;Lzzn;Laem;)V` no longer iget's its `a:Ldt0;` field directly — it constructs a coroutine continuation `Lhod;` and dispatches to it. The pattern the patch looked for now lives at `Lhod;->invokeSuspend` (lines 255/259/267), reading the AUTH_INTERFACE from `p1` (the outer iod reference) not `p0` (this is now the continuation).

Three options documented:
- **A (chosen for v1)**: Skip NAV_INTERCEPTOR entirely. Other 6 BypassLogin hooks (AUTH_IMPL fake StateFlows + NAVIGATOR i/r gates + GAME_LIB_REPO user-id getter + is0.f → FakeAuthToken) may cover the user-facing surface. Cheapest.
- **B**: Patch `Liod;->a` body wholesale (return-void or passthrough). Risk: unclear what downstream navigation expects.
- **C**: Hook `Lhod;->invokeSuspend` directly — most surgical but needs continuation-state-machine-aware edits.

If device testing reveals a login-redirect leak, implement option C. The `NAV_INTERCEPTOR` constant value is kept (`@Suppress("unused")` `"Liod;"`) and the apply block left commented in `BypassLoginPatch.kt` for archaeology.

### CI verification result

Run [`25747297755`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25747297755) on `gamehub-604-build` head `147d63c` triggered via `gh workflow run release.yml --ref gamehub-604-build -f tag=v0.0.1-604-test` (artifact-only prerelease). All 11 jobs green:

- ✅ Build patches bundle
- ✅ Patch Normal / Normal-GHL / PuBG / AnTuTu / alt-AnTuTu / PuBG-CrossFire / Ludashi / Genshin / Original (all 9 variants)
- ⏭ Create GitHub Release (intentionally skipped — `stable=false`)

Every re-anchored fingerprint matched at patcher time. 9 APK artifacts on the run (14-day retention). **Next step: device test** — install any variant, confirm launch lands on home screen (bypass login working), confirm game-import save persists (library DB writes working), confirm catalog redirect + /v6 prefix all fire. If no login-redirect leak from the skipped NAV_INTERCEPTOR, cut stable. If a leak surfaces, implement option C.

### Known caveat — release notes

`.github/workflows/release.yml` body text still narrates the 6.0.1 → 6.0.2 migration. Workflow + variant filenames + `base-apk-604` download + release title were swapped, but the long-form release-page markdown remains 6.0.2-flavored. Only relevant if `stable=true` is flipped on the next dispatch; rewrite before cutting a 6.0.4 stable release.

### Device-test pass — 2026-05-12

User installed and verified one of the run 25747297755 artifacts on real hardware. End-to-end working: bypass-login lands on home screen, catalog redirect to BannerHub Worker + /v6 prefix both firing, game-import path persists rows correctly. The skipped NAV_INTERCEPTOR (Option A) had no observable effect — the remaining six BypassLogin hooks (AUTH_IMPL h/e/d + NAVIGATOR i/r gates + GAME_LIB_REPO.e + is0.f → FakeAuthToken) cover the user-facing surface fully on 6.0.4. Option C (hook `Lhod;->invokeSuspend`) is **not needed**.

**Status:** 6.0.4 patch port is feature-complete and verified. Ready for stable cut (`v1.0.0-604`) once release.yml's body text is rewritten from 6.0.1→6.0.2 narrative to 6.0.2→6.0.4 narrative.

### Stable release — v1.0.0-604 (2026-05-12 17:56 UTC)

[`v1.0.0-604` — Gamehub 6.0.4 - BannerHub API - Patched](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/releases/tag/v1.0.0-604) is live. Stable cut as run [`25752321469`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25752321469) — all 9 variant patch jobs succeeded + the `release` job (`stable=true`), 12 assets attached (9 APKs ~114 MB each + the `.rvp` bundle/sources). Branch head at release: `508cede` on `gamehub-604-build`.

Release notes ship the 6.0.2 → 6.0.4 R8 letter remap table, the `NAV_INTERCEPTOR` skip rationale (Liod;->a's inline auth check moved into the `Lhod;` coroutine continuation in 6.0.4 — left commented in the patch source as a starting point for option C if a future regression requires it), the `FakeStateFlow` letter-trio update (`tjk/hzh/vfe` → `akk/ozh/dge`), the `Offline component cache fallback` patch's first stable shipping (was on `gamehub-602-build` post-602 stable but never made it into a release), and — at the user's call-out — the **server-side Steam-launch fix** in the BannerHub API Worker. The previous "use Lightweight Steam client only" warning is dropped from both `release.yml` and `README.md`; both standard and Lightweight Steam clients now launch games end-to-end (server-side, retroactive to existing patched builds).

Second consecutive base bump (after v1.0.0-602) where the structural-anchor recipes caught every fingerprint on the first patcher run — no .0 → .1 hotfix needed.

README updates: header bumped to 6.0.4 latest stable, v1.0.0-602 moved to historical, offline-cache "unreleased" markers dropped, Source + Build sections point at `base-apk-604` and `gamehub-604-build`, Variants table file names refresh, Known limitations drops the standard-Steam-client warning.

### Post-release tweak — xtask first-launch hint (2026-05-12)

User-flagged caveat for v1.0.0-604: if a user's **first** Steam game launch errors with `xtask install components failed`, the workaround is to open that title's PC game settings, set components manually (Wine prefix, DXVK, VKD3D, container, etc.), confirm the correct Steam client is selected, then retry — it's a one-time setup hiccup, not a fatal regression. Added to both `release.yml` body (commit `b9397c8`) and README's "what's new" Steam bullet; live `v1.0.0-604` release body refreshed via `gh release edit --notes-file` so the in-flight published page already carries the hint.

### Post-release release-page trim (2026-05-12)

User feedback: the v1.0.0-604 release page is too long; the per-patch R8 letter-by-letter delta table and the per-patch smali-edit walkthrough in the "Patches applied" table aren't useful for end users. Trimmed both:

- The base-APK-refresh section dropped its six bullet-pointed letter-by-letter remap and now just says the patches were re-anchored, with a pointer line to `gamehub_reports/GH604_LETTER_MAP.md` + the patch sources for anyone who wants the gritty detail. (commit `2771684`)
- The "Patches applied" table rows are now one-line user-facing descriptions of what each patch does, instead of the patcher-side mechanics. A single sentence below the table links to the README's Patches applied section + the patch source directory for the deeper breakdown. (commit `3b89575`)

Both updates pushed to `release.yml` for future re-cuts and mirrored onto the live `v1.0.0-604` release body via `gh release edit --notes-file`. README is intentionally untouched — its long-form section is the canonical deep-dive and the release page now links to it.

### Offline component cache fallback — flagged broken on 6.0.4 (2026-05-12)

User reported the offline component cache fallback patch isn't delivering the intended behavior at runtime on 6.0.4 despite patcher-side success (CI green, the patch applies, structural anchors all resolved correctly). Flagged as **currently broken** in `release.yml` body, the README's "what's new" bullet AND its detailed `### Offline component cache fallback` section, and at the top of `OfflineComponentCachePatch.kt` itself. Live `v1.0.0-604` release body refreshed via `gh release edit --notes-file` so users see the warning. Patch stays enabled per user direction.

Investigation angles to check on the next pass (recorded at top of the patch source):
- Has `mci.a(RepoCategory, Continuation)` itself changed shape beyond the `:goto_2` sentinel? Walk the full method body and compare against the 6.0.2 `eci.a` body the patch was designed around.
- Did `xxo`'s field layout / `xxo.c` `ConcurrentHashMap` type change? `PickerCacheFallback.fromXxo` uses single-letter field lookups (`a`, `c`) plus a runtime type sanity check; if `c`'s declared type is no longer assignable to `Map`, the sanity check returns the empty ArrayList silently — visible only via `DebugTrace`.
- Is `u6o.<init>` still the disk-hydrator? If 6.0.4 renamed/restructured the hydrator the map could simply be empty at the time the picker consults it, in which case the patch IS firing but has nothing to return.

## Vibration port to 6.0.4 — feature/vibration branch (2026-05-12)

User requested porting BannerHub PR #80 (TideGear's PC-accurate XInput rumble support, shipped in BannerHub v3.7.0 stable on 5.3.5) as a ReVanced patch for our 6.0.4 build. TideGear had already done the legwork to port it to GameHub 6.0.2 at https://github.com/TideGear/GameHub-Vibration-Fix — only 4 smali hooks on 6.0.2 (vs 5 on 5.3.5; 6.0 fixed the lazy-attach issue natively so the GamepadManager.B0 wake-up hook is unnecessary).

### Feasibility verification

Verified each of TideGear's 4 smali anchors against the 6.0.4 decompile. Trap caught: the 6.0.2 letters `Lza8;` (Physical) and `Ldg5;` (EnvBuilder) both still exist as class names in 6.0.4, but R8 reassigned them to completely unrelated classes (an empty marker interface and a coroutine continuation respectively). Naive name matching would have patched the wrong code; structural matching by method shapes + field layouts found the true 6.0.4 equivalents.

### 6.0.2 → 6.0.4 vibration-anchor delta

| Symbol | 6.0.2 (TideGear) | 6.0.4 (re-derived) | Recipe |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GamepadServerManager.onRumble(III)V` | same | same | Annotated `@Keep`, `:cond_4` label preserved |
| Physical class | `Lza8;` | `Lab8;` | `public final` extends `Lcb8;`, `g(II)V`/`f()V` shapes preserved |
| Physical.k field type | `Llrl;` | `Lxrl;` | Motor manager |
| EnvBuilder class | `Ldg5;` | `Lbg5;` | `a(...)V` `.locals 35`, anchor block lines 458-465 byte-identical |
| Join helper class | `Lns2;` | `Lps2;` | CollectionsKt joinToString$default |
| Join method name | `I0` | `I0` | **survived R8** |
| Function1 lambda type | `Low6;` | `Lpw6;` | |

### Branch state

`feature/vibration` cut off `gamehub-604-build` head `65e6902` 2026-05-12. Head: `4b25858`.

### Stage 1 — bytecode hooks + manifest registration (commit `0ae2228` → `248f7bd`)

- `extensions/gamehub/.../com/xj/winemu/vibration/BhVibrationController.java` (1106 lines, TideGear's package preserved verbatim — only Android SDK imports, no host references)
- `extensions/gamehub/.../com/xj/winemu/vibration/BhVibrationSettingsActivity.java` (266 lines)
- `patches/.../gamehub/vibration/VibrationPatch.kt` — 4 bytecode hooks with the 6.0.4 letters above
- `patches/.../gamehub/vibration/VibrationManifestPatch.kt` — registers BhVibrationSettingsActivity (exported=false, translucent theme)
- `extensions/gamehub/build.gradle.kts` — added lint suppression for `MissingPermission` / `NewApi` / `WrongConstant` (false positives — host APK declares VIBRATE permission and host targets Android 14, but extension lint runs in isolation against compile-only stubs).

CI run [`25761322965`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25761322965) green on commit `248f7bd`. Bytecode patches all applied across the 9 variants — but the LD_PRELOAD inject was inert (no .so to find at runtime).

### Stage 2 — NDK build + native-shim injection (commit `d9b9c96` → `4b25858`)

- `native/evshim/evshim.c` + `CMakeLists.txt` (TideGear's source copied verbatim — 698 lines of C, patches `winebus.so`'s `pSDL_JoystickRumble` + `pSDL_JoystickClose` .bss pointers via `LD_PRELOAD`)
- `patches/.../gamehub/vibration/VibrationLibPatch.kt` — resource patch that reads `libevshim.so` from the .rvp's classloader resources and writes it into the staged APK's `lib/arm64-v8a/`. Sentinel class (`private object VibrationLibResources`) used as classloader anchor to dodge Kotlin's self-referential type inference (can't reference `vibrationLibPatch::class` inside its own initializer body).
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — new "Build libevshim.so" step inserted before the gradle build: locates the runner's NDK, builds via cmake/ninja for arm64-v8a android-29, drops the output under `patches/src/main/resources/lib/arm64-v8a/` so gradle bakes it into the .rvp.

CI run [`25761713424`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25761713424) green on commit `4b25858`. Now end-to-end: NDK builds .so → gradle bakes it into .rvp → revanced-cli applies → resource patch copies .so into APK's lib dir → bytecode hook injects LD_PRELOAD at runtime → libevshim re-issues SDL rumble every 500ms to defeat the 1s auto-stop.

### Pending

**Device test.** Pull any variant from run 25761713424 artifacts (14-day retention) or trigger a fresh run with a named tag. Install on a phone with at least one Bluetooth rumble-capable controller (DualSense / DS4 / 8BitDo Pro 2 in XInput mode). Launch any Wine PC game that uses XInput rumble (Brawlhalla, Diablo, etc.). Expected: heavy/light motors driven independently, sustained holds last as long as the in-game rumble effect, instant release on let-go.

If the device test passes, merge `feature/vibration` → `gamehub-604-build` and cut a follow-up release (e.g. `v1.1.0-604` for the feature bump).

### Stage 3 — Hook 4 VerifyError fix (2026-05-12)

**Device crash on first game launch.** User installed a variant from run 25761713424, opened a game, and `banner.hub:wine` immediately died at `WineActivity.onCreate` with:

```
java.lang.VerifyError: Verifier rejected class bg5:
  void bg5.a(eco, java.lang.String, boolean):
  [0x1F2] target dex pc 0x28 is not at instruction start.
```

Logcat: `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/log_2026_05_12_19_54_05.log`.

**Root cause.** Hook 4 (the EnvBuilder LD_PRELOAD inject) used `addInstructions` with a label `:bh_skip_evshim_preload` placed at the END of the inserted block:

```smali
if-eqz v15, :bh_skip_evshim_preload
const/4 v15, 0x0
invoke-virtual {v12, v15, v13}, Ljava/util/ArrayList;->add(ILjava/lang/Object;)V
:bh_skip_evshim_preload
```

When `addInstructions` parses the snippet, smali assigns the trailing label an offset of *block-length-in-bytes* relative to the snippet start. The inserted block is exactly 18 instructions = 40 bytes = **0x28** — matching the verifier error target verbatim. The patcher embeds that absolute 0x28 in the resulting method, instead of resolving it to the original `invoke-static/range` that follows the injection. The `if-eqz` then branches to absolute offset 0x28 of `bg5.a`, which lands mid-instruction in the original prologue → VerifyError.

**Why Hooks 1 + 2 didn't crash with the same shape.** They insert at index 0. Snippet-relative offset *equals* absolute offset in the destination method when the shift is zero, so the bug doesn't surface. Hook 3 has no labels at all.

**Fix.** Switched Hook 4 to `addInstructionsWithLabels` + `ExternalLabel`, capturing the original `invoke-static/range` instruction at `joinIdx` *before* insertion. The patcher resolves the label by Instruction identity and tracks it correctly after insertion shifts the target index down by 18. Trailing `:bh_skip_evshim_preload` line removed from the snippet.

**Imports added.** `ExternalLabel`, `addInstructionsWithLabels` (both from `app.revanced.patcher.extensions`).

**Lesson for future bytecode patches.** When inserting at index > 0 with a forward branch that needs to skip past the inserted block, always use ExternalLabel pointing to the original instruction at the insertion index. Trailing-label-in-snippet is a footgun that only surfaces when insertion shifts > 0.

### Stage 3b — Hook 4 v14-type-mismatch fix (2026-05-12, after pre2)

**Second device crash.** v1.1.0-604-pre2 installed and the VerifyError shape changed:

```
java.lang.VerifyError: Verifier rejected class bg5:
  void bg5.a(eco, java.lang.String, boolean):
  [0x1F8] register v14 has type Reference: java.io.File
  but expected Reference: java.lang.String
```

Crash log at `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/log_2026_05_12_20_07_32_crash.log` (PID 19846, `banner.hub:wine`).

**Root cause.** Hook 4 inserts at `joinIdx` = the `invoke-static/range` of `JOIN_HELPER->I0`. The 5 instructions immediately preceding the invoke are Kotlin's joinToString$default arg setup:

```
const/16 v16, 0x0
const/16 v17, 0x3e
const-string v13, ":"
const/4 v14, 0x0       ← v14 set to ConstZero (null CharSequence)
const/4 v15, 0x0
invoke-static/range {v12..v17}, JOIN_HELPER->I0(...)
```

So inserting AT joinIdx places our File-path code *after* the setup. Our `new-instance v14, Ljava/io/File;` then overwrites v14 with `File`, and the verifier rejects the subsequent invoke with `expected Reference: java.lang.String`.

**Fix.** Move the insertion point 5 instructions earlier, to the start of the setup block (`setupStartIdx = joinIdx - 5`). Now both the fall-through and branch-taken paths from our `if-eqz` flow into the setup, which cleanly re-initializes v13..v17 to the types `invoke-static/range` expects. ExternalLabel target updated to the original `const/16 v16` instruction at `setupStartIdx`. Added a `require()` for the setup-block lookback in case a future R8 reshuffle inlines or reorders the setup.

Insertion ordering matters: when inserting `addInstructionsWithLabels` at an index, our snippet is placed *before* the existing instruction at that index. So `setupStartIdx` (= joinIdx - 5) puts our injection just before the setup; the setup then runs after our injection, before the invoke.

### Stage 3b device test — DOOMBLADE clean launch, no rumble triggered (2026-05-12 ~21:46)

v1.1.0-604-pre3 (`9681b60`) installed as `banner.hub` (Normal variant). User launched **DOOMBLADE** via DirectLaunch (Wine Proton 10 arm64x-2, FEX Game Presets, Turnip v25.0.0 R1). Wine session ran clean 21:46:12 → 21:48:36, no VerifyError, no crash. Stage 3b fix verified at the verifier level.

Initial verdict from logcat: zero `BhVibration` log lines, zero gamepad-source InputDevice events. Hooks didn't fire during this session. Hypotheses recorded at the time: either no real controller was paired, or DOOMBLADE didn't issue rumble during the playthrough (2D metroidvania, rumble fires only on specific hits).

Hook insertion verified correct in the installed APK by apktool-decompiling `/data/app/~~8kz5yy-HOJCA8DhNk4duGQ==/banner.hub-JC7NoskjYKMoBofYk4cZ7g==/base.apk`:
- Hook 1: `smali_classes7/com/winemu/core/gamepad/GamepadServerManager.smali:298` — `invoke-static {p1, p2, p3}, Lcom/xj/winemu/vibration/BhVibrationController;->onRumble(III)Z` ✅
- Hook 2: `smali_classes2/ab8.smali:511` — `dispatchToController(III)Z` ✅
- Hook 3: `smali_classes2/ab8.smali:438` — `onStop(I)V` ✅
- Hook 4: `smali_classes8/bg5.smali:985,993` — `nativeLibraryDir` + `/libevshim.so` injection ✅
- `lib/arm64-v8a/libevshim.so` shipped, 41,384 bytes ✅

### Stage 3b — GTA 5 Enhanced device test: VIBRATION CONFIRMED (2026-05-12)

User retested v1.1.0-604-pre3 (`9681b60`) with **GTA 5 Enhanced** and a real controller. **Rumble works.** Device-confirmed end-to-end:

- `GamepadServerManager.onRumble` → `BhVibrationController.onRumble` invoke path active
- Per-controller dispatch via Hook 2 (`ab8.g(II)V`) firing
- libevshim.so LD_PRELOAD keepalive holding rumble past SDL2's 1s auto-stop
- Stop hook (Hook 3, `ab8.f()V`) releasing cleanly

This unblocks the merge: `feature/vibration` ready to land on `gamehub-604-build`.

### Merged into gamehub-604-build 2026-05-12

Pre-merge commit `7d149f1` (docs: GTA 5 confirmation + stable-release-pipeline spec section) pushed to `origin/feature/vibration`, then:

```
git checkout gamehub-604-build
git merge --no-ff feature/vibration
git push origin gamehub-604-build
```

Merge commit: **`222730a`** (`Merge feature/vibration into gamehub-604-build`). `--no-ff` preserves the 8-commit feature history under the merge commit so the staged Verifier-error debugging trail (Stage 1 → 3b) stays readable in `git log --graph`.

`gamehub-604-build` head 65e6902 → 222730a on origin. `feature/vibration` left at `7d149f1` on origin (not deleted — kept as a reference for the verifier-fix post-mortem).

## 2026-05-13 — Stable release pipeline implemented on feature/stable-release-pipeline

User chose option (a): make `v1.1.0-604` itself the new-cert anchor instead of shipping it on the old ephemeral key first. **One uninstall, ever.**

### Keystore

Generated `keystore/bannerhub.keystore` via:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -keystore keystore/bannerhub.keystore \
  -alias bannerhub \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 36500 \
  -storepass bannerhub -keypass bannerhub \
  -dname "CN=BannerHub, OU=ReVanced, O=The412Banner, C=US"
```

Cert fingerprints (LOCKED IN — CI must print this SHA-256 on every release):

- **SHA-256:** `10:89:5A:31:1F:E0:4F:95:F8:2E:4D:A5:C9:A6:C0:41:BA:92:82:BF:21:1F:1B:57:8F:E1:CB:EB:89:4C:E0:BA`
- **SHA-1:** `1F:51:B2:5E:5C:9F:58:08:E0:CF:45:17:4F:CC:B3:8D:67:CA:6D:E5`
- **Serial:** `5ee03b1e340fd1ac`
- **Validity:** 2026-05-13 → 2126-04-19 (100 years)
- **Signature algorithm:** SHA384withRSA
- **Schemes used at sign time:** v1 + v2 + v3 (v4 disabled — no `.idsig` sidecar)

Passwords (`bannerhub`/`bannerhub`) and full security model documented in `keystore/README.md`.

### release.yml changes

- **Hybrid trigger**: kept `push: tags: ["v*", "GameHub-*"]`; replaced the `tag` workflow_dispatch input with a `version` input (e.g. `1.1.0-604-pre1`, strip leading `v`). The workflow derives `version` (and `tag` = `v${version}`) from whichever source fired, in a new build-job step `Derive version` that exposes job-level outputs.
- **Filename**: drop the hardcoded `variant.file:` matrix column; compute filename as `BannerHub-V6-${{ needs.build.outputs.version }}-Patched-${{ matrix.variant.name }}.apk` in both the patch step and the artifact upload path.
- **Labels**: matrix `variant.label:` rewritten to "BannerHub v6 …" — three variants share the bare "BannerHub v6" label (Normal, Normal-GHL, Original); AnTuTu and alt-AnTuTu share "BannerHub v6 AnTuTu"; rest are unique.
- **Patch job checkout**: added `actions/checkout@v5` to the patch job so apksigner can read the keystore from the repo.
- **Re-sign step**: new step right after `Apply patches`. Uses `${ANDROID_HOME}/build-tools/<latest>/apksigner` with `--ks keystore/bannerhub.keystore --ks-pass pass:bannerhub --ks-key-alias bannerhub --key-pass pass:bannerhub --v1-signing-enabled true --v2-signing-enabled true --v3-signing-enabled true --v4-signing-enabled false`. Followed by `apksigner verify --print-certs` so the cert SHA-256 surfaces in CI logs each run.
- **Release job**: now needs both `build` and `patch`; dropped the standalone "Get tag name" step (was reading `inputs.tag`); uses `${{ needs.build.outputs.tag }}` for the release tag and `${{ needs.build.outputs.version }}` for body interpolation; release body rewritten — title is now `BannerHub v6 ${{ version }}`, replaced the 6.0.2→6.0.4 base-bump section with a "Stable signing — in-place updates from this release onward" section, updated variant table with new filenames + labels, updated migration note, file glob changed `GameHub-6.0.4-Patched-*.apk` → `BannerHub-V6-*.apk`.

### README + keystore/README.md

- README banner rewritten from "fresh install required" to "In-place updates — from v1.1.0-604 onward". Variant table updated with new filenames + labels. New `## Signing` section after `## Variants` with cert SHA-256 + SHA-1 fingerprints.
- `keystore/README.md` written: full security model (public test key, anyone can re-sign), keystore fields table, fingerprints, generation command, CI usage, one-time migration note.

### Validated 2026-05-13

- Branch pushed at `67b65ed` (commit `feat(release): stable test-keystore signing + BannerHub-V6 naming`)
- Validation run [`25775495418`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25775495418) — all 9 patch jobs green, release job correctly skipped (stable=false)
- Verified all 9 artifacts:
  - Filename pattern `BannerHub-V6-1.1.0-604-pre1-Patched-{variant}.apk` rendered correctly for every variant (Normal-GHL uses the hyphen form; no parentheses needed)
  - apksigner cert SHA-256 = `10895a311fe04f95f82e4da5c9a6c041ba9282bf211f1b578fe1cbeb894ce0ba` for every variant — matches `keystore/README.md` byte-for-byte
  - apksigner found at `/usr/local/lib/android/sdk/build-tools/37.0.0/apksigner` (auto-discovered via the `ls -d "${ANDROID_HOME}/build-tools"/* | sort -V | tail -1` lookup)
- Artifacts available for 14 days under run 25775495418's artifacts tab

### Merged 2026-05-13

`feature/stable-release-pipeline` (head `7344420`, 2 commits) merged into `gamehub-604-build` at **merge commit `41a2b27`** with `--no-ff` so the feature history is preserved under the merge commit. Pushed to origin.

`gamehub-604-build` head e26529b → 41a2b27. `feature/stable-release-pipeline` left at `7344420` on origin (not deleted — kept as a reference branch).

### Pending

- ☐ Pre2 rebuild on `gamehub-604-build` to verify in-place updates: `gh workflow run release.yml --ref gamehub-604-build -f version=1.1.0-604-pre2 -f stable=false`. Expected: same cert SHA-256 `10895a311fe04f95f82e4da5c9a6c041ba9282bf211f1b578fe1cbeb894ce0ba`. User will install pre1 (from run 25775495418 artifacts), then install pre2 on top to confirm Android accepts the upgrade with no uninstall.
- ☐ When ready, cut `v1.1.0-604` stable: `gh workflow run release.yml --ref gamehub-604-build -f version=1.1.0-604 -f stable=true`. Release notes should call out the one-time uninstall for users on v1.0.0-604 or older.

## 2026-05-13 — feature/app-icon: launcher icon + wine_logo rebrand

New branch `feature/app-icon` off `gamehub-604-build`. Single resource patch (`ChangeAppIconPatch`) that swaps two drawables in the staged APK without touching bytecode.

### Source

`/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub v6_icon.png` — user-provided, 918×903 RGBA with alpha. Centered logo content, transparent surround.

### Generated patch resources

Both checked in to `patches/src/main/resources/bannerhub-icon/`:

| File | Dimensions | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ic_launcher_foreground.png` | 432×432 RGBA | Adaptive-icon foreground at xxxhdpi (108 dp). BannerHub logo content fit to the inner 288×288 safe zone, outer 18 dp margin reserved for launcher masking + parallax. |
| `wine_logo.png` | 240×72 RGBA | Drop-in replacement for the original `drawable-xxhdpi/wine_logo.png`. Square BannerHub icon resized to 72×72 and centered with transparent left/right padding so the 80×24 dp intrinsic measure stays identical and no ImageView layouts regress. |

Generated via ImageMagick:
```
magick "$SRC" -resize "288x288" -gravity center -background transparent -extent "432x432" ic_launcher_foreground.png
magick "$SRC" -resize "72x72" -gravity center -background transparent -extent "240x72" wine_logo.png
```

### Patch source

`patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/icon/ChangeAppIconPatch.kt`. Resource patch only (no bytecode, no manifest). Apply block:

1. Stream `bannerhub-icon/ic_launcher_foreground.png` → `res/drawable-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_foreground.png` (creates the file)
2. **Delete** `res/drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml` — the stock GameHub vector. Without this delete, aapt2 keeps both definitions and lower-density devices fall back to the vector (= still GameHub). Deleting forces every density bucket to use the xxxhdpi raster.
3. Stream `bannerhub-icon/wine_logo.png` → `res/drawable-xxhdpi/wine_logo.png` (overwrites stock)

Uses the same sentinel-object classloader pattern as `VibrationLibPatch` (Kotlin's self-referential type-inference snag).

### Background drawable

Intentionally left alone. Adaptive-icon backgrounds are mostly masked away by launcher shapes (circle/squircle/rounded-rect); only a sliver shows at the edge of the foreground. The default GameHub background works fine behind the new foreground content.

### wine_logo usage

R.drawable.wine_logo (resource ID `0x7f080180`, declared in `res/values/public.xml:1273`) is referenced from one place in code: `smali_classes2/ego.smali:1218` via `sget v0, Lyqh;->wine_logo:I` — looks like a Wine-container header/splash logo. Replacing the bitmap content keeps the resource ID stable, so no smali edit is needed.

### Validated 2026-05-13

- Branch + commit: `feature/app-icon` @ `022f10f`, pushed to origin
- Validation run [`25776533760`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25776533760) on `feature/app-icon` with `version=1.1.0-604-pre3 stable=false` — all 9 patch jobs green, release job correctly skipped
- Confirmed per-job:
  - `"Change app icon" succeeded` log line on every variant
  - Output filename `BannerHub-V6-1.1.0-604-pre3-Patched-{variant}.apk` (icon patch did not break the stable-release-pipeline naming)
  - apksigner cert SHA-256 = `10895a311fe04f95f82e4da5c9a6c041ba9282bf211f1b578fe1cbeb894ce0ba` on every variant — byte-for-byte identical to pre1 (run 25775495418) and pre2 (run 25775755966), so an in-place upgrade install of pre3 over pre2 should be accepted by Android without uninstall
- Artifacts live 14 days under run 25776533760

### Pre4 — added 2 Compose Multiplatform auth-screen logos to same patch (2026-05-13)

User asked to additionally rebrand:
- `assets/composeResources/com.xiaoji.egggame.features.auth/drawable/features_auth_ic_logo_landscape.png` (stock 96×96 square — "landscape" refers to auth-screen orientation, not image aspect) — replaced with BannerHub icon scaled to 96×96 with transparent padding
- `assets/composeResources/com.xiaoji.egggame.features.auth/drawable/features_auth_ic_logo_overseas.png` (stock 366×72, 5.08:1 wide) — replaced with user-supplied 2277×448 RGB source `/storage/emulated/0/Download/ADM/features_auth_ic_logo_overseas.png` direct-downscaled (aspect ratio matched exactly, no padding). RGB→RGB transition acceptable since auth screen has opaque background.

Extended `ChangeAppIconPatch` (still ONE patch, one entry in `revanced-cli list-patches`) with two more `copy()` calls. Refactored apply block to factor out the classloader-load + parent-mkdirs + stream-copy pattern into a local helper, eliminating four near-identical blocks.

CN-locale auth logo (`features_auth_ic_logo_cn.png`, 270×72) intentionally left alone — not shown on overseas builds.

Branch head: `718d241`. Validation [run 25777014627](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25777014627) all 9 patch jobs green, `"Change app icon" succeeded` on every variant, apksigner cert SHA-256 = `10895a311fe04f95f82e4da5c9a6c041ba9282bf211f1b578fe1cbeb894ce0ba` (unchanged across pre1 → pre2 → pre3 → pre4 → upgrades between any pair should be in-place).

### Pre5 — added splash_logo to same patch (2026-05-13)

User asked to additionally rebrand `assets/composeResources/com.xiaoji.egggame.features.splash/drawable/splash_logo.png` (stock 996×200, 4.98:1 aspect, RGBA) using the same overseas-banner artwork source. Same 5.08:1 aspect on the source; resolved by resizing to 996×196 to preserve proportions exactly, then `-extent 996x200` to pad 2 px of transparency top + bottom. Output is RGBA so a future splash background change (e.g. dark mode) can bleed through cleanly.

ImageMagick produces RGBA automatically when an RGB input is `-extent`'d with a transparent background — useful pattern.

ChangeAppIconPatch (still ONE patch) now ships **five** drawables in its apply block: launcher foreground (+ vector delete), wine_logo, auth landscape, auth overseas, splash. CN-locale `drawable-zh-rCN/splash_logo.png` left alone — same policy as `features_auth_ic_logo_cn.png` (not displayed on overseas builds).

Branch head: `0d55adf`. Validation [run 25777391685](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25777391685) all 9 patch jobs green, `"Change app icon" succeeded` on every variant, cert SHA-256 = `10895a311fe04f95f82e4da5c9a6c041ba9282bf211f1b578fe1cbeb894ce0ba` (unchanged pre1 → pre5).

### Merged 2026-05-13

`feature/app-icon` (head `46a1a6e`, 6 commits — 3 feat + 3 docs) merged into `gamehub-604-build` at **merge commit `bf2882e`** with `--no-ff` so the per-pre stages stay readable in `git log --graph`. Pushed to origin. **No CI triggered** by the branch push — `release.yml` fires on tag push or workflow_dispatch only.

`gamehub-604-build` head e3c708a → bf2882e. `feature/app-icon` left at `46a1a6e` on origin as a reference branch.

### Post-merge sanity build 2026-05-13 (pre6 on gamehub-604-build)

User triggered an artifacts-only build of `gamehub-604-build` @ `841a0ba` after the icon-patch merge to verify the merged tree builds clean: `gh workflow run release.yml --ref gamehub-604-build -f version=1.1.0-604-pre6 -f stable=false`.

[Run 25777687347](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25777687347) — all 9 patch jobs green, `Create GitHub Release` correctly skipped (stable=false). Per-job:
- `"Change app icon" succeeded` on every variant
- apksigner cert SHA-256 = `10895a311fe04f95f82e4da5c9a6c041ba9282bf211f1b578fe1cbeb894ce0ba` (unchanged pre1 → pre6)

Confirms vibration patch + stable-release-pipeline + 5-drawable icon patch all coexist cleanly. Artifacts live 14 days at the run URL.

### Pending

- ☐ User device-tests pre6 (or pre5/pre4) Normal installed on top of any earlier new-cert build:
  1. Android accepts the upgrade with no uninstall
  2. Launcher tile shows BannerHub icon
  3. wine_logo rebrand visible somewhere in-app
  4. Auth-screen logos rebranded on login flow
  5. Splash screen on app launch shows BannerHub banner
- ☐ When user gives the go-ahead, cut `v1.1.0-604` stable: `gh workflow run release.yml --ref gamehub-604-build -f version=1.1.0-604 -f stable=true`. First new-cert release; release notes should call out the one-time uninstall for users on v1.0.0-604 or older.

### Per-game hamburger-menu Vibration Settings option — NOT in this build

User asked whether the per-game hamburger-menu "Vibration Settings" item from BannerHub 3.7.2 stable also ships in the ReVanced build. **No.** The ReVanced patch set only registers `com.xj.winemu.vibration.BhVibrationSettingsActivity` in the manifest with `exported="false"` and no `<intent-filter>` (`VibrationManifestPatch.kt:32-37`). There is no patch under `patches/.../gamehub/` that injects a menu item into the XJ Java/XML UI to launch that activity — that would be a separate bytecode patch (find the per-game menu adapter R8 class, inject a row that fires an explicit Intent to `BhVibrationSettingsActivity --es gameId <gid>`).

Functionally rumble still works without the UI: `BhVibrationController.java:98-99` defaults to `MODE_CONTROLLER` at intensity 100. The settings activity only adjusts per-game mode/intensity overrides.

Follow-up task (after rumble is confirmed working in GTA 5): port the menu-item injection as a new bytecode patch.

## 2026-05-12 — Stable release pipeline spec approved (NOT executed yet)

User-approved spec for the next-but-one release cycle. Execution is **gated on**: (1) GTA 5 + real-controller retest of `feature/vibration` head `9681b60` confirming rumble, (2) merging `feature/vibration` → `gamehub-604-build`, (3) cutting `v1.1.0-604` stable on the **old ephemeral key** (final release before the cert switch). Only after that do we branch `feature/stable-release-pipeline` off the updated `gamehub-604-build` and apply the changes below.

### Goal

Replace revanced-cli's per-run ephemeral keystore with a checked-in test keystore so the signing cert is stable across releases. After a one-time uninstall break for users on the v1.0.0-604 ephemeral-key build, every future stable updates in-place (no uninstall, no `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`).

### Spec

- **Tag format:** `vX.Y.Z-{branch-base#}` — e.g. `v1.1.0-604`. `604` derived from `patches/.../gamehub/Constants.kt:GAMEHUB_VERSION = "6.0.4"` and the `base-apk-604` GitHub release. Pre-releases: `vX.Y.Z-{branch-base#}-preN`.

- **APK filename:** `BannerHub-V6-{version}-Patched-{variant}.apk` where `version = ${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}`. Drops the hardcoded `variant.file:` column from the matrix; computed at workflow level.

- **App labels (9-variant table):** three variants share the bare "BannerHub v6" label (Normal, Normal-GHL, Original) and install side-by-side via different package names — same pattern as the two AnTuTu variants which share "BannerHub v6 AnTuTu".

  | variant.name | variant.pkg | variant.label |
  |---|---|---|
  | Normal | banner.hub | BannerHub v6 |
  | Normal-GHL | gamehub.lite | BannerHub v6 |
  | PuBG | com.tencent.ig | BannerHub v6 PuBG |
  | AnTuTu | com.antutu.ABenchMark | BannerHub v6 AnTuTu |
  | alt-AnTuTu | com.antutu.benchmark.full | BannerHub v6 AnTuTu |
  | PuBG-CrossFire | com.tencent.tmgp.cf | BannerHub v6 PuBG CrossFire |
  | Ludashi | com.ludashi.aibench | BannerHub v6 Ludashi |
  | Genshin | com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact | BannerHub v6 Genshin |
  | Original | com.xiaoji.egggame | BannerHub v6 |

- **Test keystore at `keystore/bannerhub.keystore`** (RSA 2048, 100-year validity, alias `bannerhub`, store and key password both `bannerhub`, DN `CN=BannerHub, OU=ReVanced, O=The412Banner, C=US`). Public test key — committed to repo, documented in `keystore/README.md` alongside cert SHA-256.

- **apksigner post-sign step** with `--v1-signing-enabled true --v2-signing-enabled true --v3-signing-enabled true --v4-signing-enabled false`, runs after revanced-cli `--out`. Followed by `apksigner verify --print-certs` so CI logs surface the cert SHA-256 every run for eyeball verification.

- **`build_pull_request.yml`** untouched — PR test artifacts continue with revanced-cli's ephemeral keystore.

### Sequencing checklist

1. ☐ GTA 5 + real controller retest of `feature/vibration` head `9681b60`
2. ☐ Merge `feature/vibration` → `gamehub-604-build` if green
3. ☐ Cut `v1.1.0-604` stable on the **old ephemeral key** (final release before cert switch)
4. ☐ Branch `feature/stable-release-pipeline` off updated `gamehub-604-build`
5. ☐ Generate + commit keystore at `keystore/bannerhub.keystore`, write `keystore/README.md`
6. ☐ Update `release.yml` (matrix, filename template, label table, apksigner step)
7. ☐ Update README "Signing" section + release-notes copy
8. ☐ Validate via non-stable `workflow_dispatch`; inspect filenames + cert SHA-256 in logs
9. ☐ Merge `feature/stable-release-pipeline` → `gamehub-604-build`
10. ☐ Tag `v1.1.1-604` (or `v1.2.0-604`) — **new-cert anchor**; release notes call out the one-time uninstall
11. ☐ Lock cert SHA-256 into memory + README for permanent verification reference

## 2026-05-13 — Per-game menu integration recon

User wants a 5th menu row "PC Vibration Settings" in the per-game library popup (PC Game Settings / Add to Desktop / Remove from Library / Edit Cover). Pure Compose Multiplatform, heavy R8 obfuscation. Full architecture mapped this session before the patch implementation begins.

### Menu Composable host

**`smali_classes4/x57.smali`** (18,783 lines), method `a(Lf37;Lpo7;Lv83;I)V` (line 214 → ~7807). Per-game menu rows built lines ~3120-3300.

### Row data class

`Liae;` (file `smali/iae.smali`):
| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `a` | `Lo05;` | Icon (Painter / vector) |
| `b` | `Ljava/lang/String;` | Resolved label string |
| `c` | `Lpw6;` | onClick (Function1<Object, Object>) |
| `d` | `Z` | Enabled boolean |

Constructor: `<init>(Lo05;Ljava/lang/String;Lpw6;)V` (3-arg overload defaults d=true).

### Click handler interface

`Lpw6;` = Compose's `Function1` — single abstract method `invoke(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;`.

### Label resolver lookup

`Lwhl;` is the only ComposableSingletons holder containing all four menu labels:
- `Lwhl;->S:Lxrl;` — `Lwgl(23)` = `common_game_remove_from_library` ✓ verified
- `Lwhl;->e0:Lxrl;` — `Ldhl(13)` = `game_cover_edit_title` ✓ verified
- Two more (PC Game Settings + Add to Desktop) in the same singleton

### Compose label int values (verified by walking pswitch tables)

- `Lghl(25)` → `features_winemu_entrance_setting` ("PC Game Settings")
- `Ltfl(20)` → `features_game_add_to_desktop` ("Add to Desktop")
- `Lwgl(23)` → `common_game_remove_from_library` ("Remove from Library")
- `Ldhl(13)` → `game_cover_edit_title` ("Edit Cover")

### Canonical row construction pattern (x57 lines ~3130-3210)

```smali
:goto_30
if-eqz v36, :cond_66                                 ; row-visible state guard

invoke-virtual {v7}, Ln49;->u()V                     ; Composer.endReplaceableGroup
```

### Implementation plan

Two artifacts:

1. **Java helper** `extensions/gamehub/src/main/java/com/xj/winemu/vibration/BhMenuRowClick.java` implementing `kotlin.jvm.functions.Function1<Object, Object>`:
   - Walks `ActivityThread` (reflection — same pattern `BhVibrationController.maybeResolveContainerFromActivityStack` already uses) to find current top Activity
   - Reads gameId Intent extra from the active WineActivity if present
   - Fires `currentActivity.startActivity(Intent(currentActivity, BhVibrationSettingsActivity.class).putExtra("gameId", gameId))`

2. **Bytecode patch** `patches/.../gamehub/vibration/VibrationMenuRowPatch.kt`:
   - Structural anchor: find a method with `sget-object .*Lwhl;->S:Lxrl;` AND `Lx9d;->add(Object)Z` AND `Liae;-><init>(Lo05;Ljava/lang/String;Lpw6;)V`
   - Just before the method's final return (or at the end of the row-construction block), inject the smali to construct a new `Liae("PC Vibration Settings", icon, BhMenuRowClick(), true)` and append to `v4` via `Lx9d;->add`
   - Use ExternalLabel pattern via `addInstructionsWithLabels`; reserve fresh free registers; preserve Composer state-group balance with paired `Ln49.g0` / `Ln49.u`

### Risk factors / iteration expectations

- Compose `Composer.startReplaceableGroup` / `endReplaceableGroup` pairs must match — wrong boundary = ART verifier crash on app start
- Compose's `Ln49.i` / `Ln49.S` / `Ln49.p0` remember-state slot tracking has strict invariants
- Register reuse: `v7` (Composer), `v4` (list builder), `v10` / `v15` (constants) must not clobber
- Expect 2-4 CI cycles to pass verifier + 1-2 device-test cycles to confirm row renders cleanly without crashing the popup

### Recon files referenced

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `x57.smali` | Menu Composable host (18,783 lines, method `a()` builds rows) |
| `iae.smali` | Row data class `Liae(icon, label, onClick, enabled)` |
| `b47.smali` | Compose-emitted onClick closure (`Lpw6` impl, 4-field captured state) |
| `cge.smali` | State delegate interface (NOT click handler — `MutableState`-like) |
| `pw6.smali` | Function1 interface — actual click-handler type |
| `whl.smali` | ComposableSingletons holder for menu labels |
| `ghl.smali` / `tfl.smali` / `wgl.smali` / `dhl.smali` | Label string resolvers (packed-switch on int → string key) |
| `vhl.smali` / `shl.smali` / `zhl.smali` | Other singletons (NOT the per-game menu) |
| `jfd.smali` | ViewModel (game detail), 16-way Lhed sealed dispatch |
| `ddd.smali` | FlowCollector handling 13 sealed event types |
| `ycd.smali` | Edit Cover confirm closure |
| `j47.smali` | Composable lambda factory (5 different ctors, 14-callback variant) |
| `igg.smali:21668` | Builds j47 with `Ljava/util/List;` of menu rows |

### AppNavKey concrete names found

| AppNavKey class | Obfuscated |
|---|---|
| `AppNavKey$PcGameSettingEntrance` | `Lff0;` |
| `AppNavKey$GamepadVibrationSetting` | `Ltd0;` (built-in 6.0.4 — different from our BhVibrationSettingsActivity) |

## 2026-05-13 — Patch iterations (pre7 → pre11)

Branch `feature/menu-vibration-row`. Iteration trail captured in memory file `project_bannerhub_revanced_vibration.md`:

| Pre | Commit | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| pre7 | `2d0c85c` | Kotlin compile fail (`Pair<...>.addInstructions` doesn't exist — use `firstMethod`) |
| pre8 | `8b1cb3f` | ART verifier reject — in-line smali clobbered v9 with `BhMenuRowClick` type, breaking downstream type-flow merge at `:goto_35` |
| pre9 | `28c5bd3` | Helper called repeatedly but failed `!pw6Cls.isInstance(click)` — R8 renamed `kotlin.jvm.functions.Function1` → `Lpw6;` so our extension's Function1 impl is a different JVM class |
| pre10 | `7eb024e` | ✅ Row appears in game-details More Menu — `java.lang.reflect.Proxy` implementing Lpw6 satisfies the Iae ctor type check |
| pre11 | `19080af` | Added 2nd injection in `ted.smali f()` for library tile popup — but logcat confirms helper never called; ted.f() is NOT the library tile popup |

### Confirmed working surface

`x57.smali` method `a(Lf37;Lpo7;Lv83;I)V` injection at lastAddIdx+1:
```
invoke-static {v4}, Lcom/xj/winemu/vibration/BhMenuRowClick;->appendVibrationRowTo(Ljava/lang/Object;)V
```
Helper reflectively constructs `Liae(icon, "PC Vibration Settings", Proxy<Lpw6>)` and appends to list builder `Lx9d` at `v4`. Renders as 5th item in the game-details screen "More Menu" popup. Device-confirmed via screenshot 2026-05-13 08:04.

## 2026-05-13 — BOTH menus working at pre17 🎉

After 10 iterations (pre7 → pre17), the library tile popup row now ALSO works.

### What got it across the line

Pre15-16 silently had a `PatchException: classDef is null` in the resolver short-circuit's `addInstructionsWithLabels`-via-`ExternalLabel` path. revanced-cli reported the OVERALL job as success because the per-patch SEVERE error doesn't fail the CI run. The 3 other injections landed but the resolver patch silently no-op'd, leaving rows in pzc.j0's output pointing at unresolvable Lell keys that crashed at render time.

Pre17 switched to plain `addInstructions` (no labels) at index 0 — works because the trailing-label-in-snippet footgun only applies mid-method. Index 0 lets the snippet-relative offset equal the absolute offset.

### Final injection pattern (3 sites + 1 resolver patch)

1. **Game-details "More Menu"** (`Lx57.a()`): `addInstructions(lastAddIdx+1, "invoke-static {v4}, ...->appendVibrationRowTo(Object)V")` → Java helper builds `Liae(icon, label-as-String, Proxy<Lpw6>)` and `list.add()`s.
2. **Library tile popup** (`Lpzc.j0()`): hook the return — `addInstructions(returnIdx, "invoke-static {vN}, ...->appendLibraryPopupRow(Object)List; \n move-result-object vN")` → Java helper builds `Lz4e(Lell-via-Unsafe, Proxy<Lnw6>, 0)` and returns augmented ArrayList.
3. **Resolver short-circuit** (`Lxd3.l1()`): `addInstructions(0, "invoke-static {p0}, ...->maybeResolveCustomLabel(Object)String; \n move-result-object v0 \n if-eqz v0, :tail \n return-object v0 \n :tail")` → Java helper returns "PC Vibration Settings" for our sentinel key, null for everything else.
4. **Compose resource entry** (`VibrationMenuLabelPatch`): appends to `assets/composeResources/com.xiaoji.egggame.features.home/values*/strings.commonMain.cvr` for documentation/future-use (actual mechanism is #3 since Compose Multiplatform's runtime needs a manifest registration the bare .cvr doesn't provide).

### Three architectural challenges solved

- **R8 renamed kotlin.jvm.functions.Function0/1** to `Lnw6;`/`Lpw6;`. Extension's `implements Function1` doesn't satisfy `pw6Cls.isInstance()`. Fix: `java.lang.reflect.Proxy.newProxyInstance` implementing the renamed interface.
- **Lell is an empty Kotlin subclass** of abstract `Ltdi(String, Set)`. Lell.smali has NO `.method`, NO `.field`. JVM-level the host does `new-instance + invoke-direct Ltdi.<init>`. `Lell.class.getDeclaredConstructor` returns nothing. Fix: `sun.misc.Unsafe.allocateInstance` + reflect-set the inherited fields `Ltdi.a` (key) and `Ltdi.b` (Set).
- **Compose resource keys** for library popup labels go through `Lxd3.l1` resolver which throws on unknown keys. Just appending to the .cvr isn't enough — runtime needs a manifest. Fix: bytecode short-circuit the resolver at its head.

### Full engineering reference

The reusable playbook (with smali patterns, register conventions, common pitfalls, full code snippets) lives in `project_bannerhub_revanced_menu_injection_playbook.md`. Future menu-row additions should start there.

### Critical CI anti-pattern caught

`revanced-cli` reports per-patch failures as `SEVERE:` log lines but the OVERALL CI job exits 0. Always grep CI logs for SEVERE after every iteration — wasted pre15 and pre16 by assuming "all 9 variants green" meant all patches landed.

```bash
gh run view --log --job <id> | grep -E "SEVERE|INFO.*<patch name>"
```

### Device confirmation 2026-05-13 12:51

Library tile 3-dot popup screenshot shows 5 rows in vertical text-only list:
- PC Game Settings
- Add to Desktop
- Remove from Library
- Edit Cover
- **PC Vibration Settings** ← OUR row

Game-details "More Menu" still has its own PC Vibration row from pre10. Both surfaces working independently.

### Pending

- ☐ Tap-test "PC Vibration Settings" in the library popup → confirm it opens BhVibrationSettingsActivity dialog (haven't device-tested the click yet, just the row rendering)
- ☐ When ready, cut `v1.1.0-604` stable — first release with full menu integration

### Merged 2026-05-13

`feature/menu-vibration-row` (14 commits, head `f472868`) merged into `gamehub-604-build` at **merge commit `91947fe`** with `--no-ff` so the pre7→pre17 iteration trail is preserved under the merge commit. Pushed to origin. `gamehub-604-build` head `4d609f0` → `91947fe`.

Will trigger an artifacts-only build to verify the merged tree builds clean.

### 2026-05-13 — README "What's new" trim

Per user: "under the what's new section of the read me only show the latest release." Removed the five historical "What's new" sections from `README.md` (v1.0.0-604 historical, v1.0.0-602, v1.0.1-601 hotfix, v1.0.0-601, v1.0.1-600) — collectively ~45 lines. Left a one-line pointer note directing readers to the per-release pages for past notes, then kept the existing `---` separator and `## What this is` header in place. Top-of-README "What's new" now shows only `v1.1.0-604`.

### 2026-05-13 — README "Known limitations" section removed

Per user: "remove the known limitatiin section." Dropped the `## ⚠ Known limitations — please read` block from `README.md`. Both bullets in that section were already strikethroughs of fixed issues (standard Steam client launches + missing cover-art-on-import), both fixed server-side in the BannerHub Worker and retroactively applied to existing patched builds. README now flows `## What this is` → `## Source` directly.

### 2026-05-13 — README "Patches applied" wrapped in collapsible `<details>`

Per user: "make the patches applied collapsed with a button/link to expand." Kept the `## Patches applied` header (so the `#patches-applied` anchor referenced from the top-of-README nav still resolves) and wrapped the entire body (intro paragraph through "Disabled-by-default options") in a `<details><summary><strong>📦 Click to expand the full patch list (17 patches + disabled-by-default options)</strong></summary>` block. Closing `</details>` sits immediately before `## Build it yourself` to keep section boundaries clean. Matches the same collapsible pattern used in `release.yml`'s release-notes template.

### 2026-05-13 — README Discord badge + AI Disclaimer added

Per user: "add the discord server badge and ai disclaimer at the top also please" + verbatim disclaimer text. Two README changes:

1. **Discord shield badge** — centered `<p>` with a Shields.io for-the-badge style discord badge (`https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Join%20the%20community-5865F2?logo=discord&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge`) linking to `discord.gg/n8S4G2WZQ4` (the The412Banner community invite, per `feedback_discord_link_new_repos.md`). Placed between the subtitle paragraph and the existing in-page nav bar.
2. **AI Disclaimer section** — new `## AI Disclaimer` H2 inserted right after the in-place-updates callout and before `## What's new in v1.1.0-604`. Two paragraphs verbatim from the user, with the model name bolded and `logcat` set as inline code. Also added an `· AI disclaimer` entry to the in-page nav bar so readers can jump straight to it from the top.

### 2026-05-13 — Branch 1 MERGED to `gamehub-604-build` (Plans 8a + 8b)

`feature/strip-privacy-permissions-ota` (head `7302aae`) merged into `gamehub-604-build` at merge commit `6817568` (`--no-ff` so the patch-add history stays under the merge). Post-merge sanity build queued as run 25830638192.

Status after this merge: Plans 4 + 5 + 8a + 8b all live on `gamehub-604-build`. Remaining: Plan 8c (heartbeat strip, recon done — Branch 2 next), Plans 1+7 (analytics-event redirect via Worker), Plan 9 (PRIVACY.md). Plans 2 + 3 + 6 deliberately skipped. Privacy series inventory: `project_bannerhub_revanced_privacy_hardening.md`.

### 2026-05-13 — feature/strip-privacy-permissions-ota — Branch 1 of Plan 8 ports

User: "begin" — kicking off Branch 1 (Plan 8a + 8b together) after the Plan 6 N/A finding and Plan 8 inventory.

**Patches written (2 files on `feature/strip-privacy-permissions-ota`):**

1. **`misc/analytics/StripAdIdPermissionsPatch.kt`** — `resourcePatch`. Removes the three `<uses-permission>` declarations for `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID`, `android.permission.ACCESS_ADSERVICES_ATTRIBUTION`, `android.permission.ACCESS_ADSERVICES_AD_ID` from the manifest root. Collect-then-remove pattern (avoid live-NodeList iteration issues). Idempotent. Strengthens Plan 4 — that one disables collection via `<meta-data>` kill-switches but the declared permissions still flag privacy scanners.

2. **`misc/ota/DisableOtaUpdatesPatch.kt`** — `bytecodePatch` + private `otaCleanupResourcePatch` dependency.
   - **Bytecode layer**: anchors structurally on any method containing a `const-string` whose value starts with `https://www.xiaoji.com/firmware/update`. In 6.0.4 this resolves to `smali_classes4/ki4.smali` method `ki4.d(String, String, I, ci3)Object` at instruction `const-string v2, "https://www.xiaoji.com/firmware/update/x1"`. After the const-string load, inserts `const-string v$urlReg, "http://127.0.0.1"` so the URL register holds the loopback before downstream HTTP code reads it. No control-flow changes, no try/catch label disruption.
   - **Resource layer (`otaCleanupResourcePatch`)**: strips `libJieLiUsbOta.so` and `libjl_ota_auth.so` (1 arch dir each in 6.0.4) — JieLi gamepad-firmware native libs that are dead weight on a phone install.
   - **5.3.5 → 6.0.4 delta**: the original 5.3.5 patch's URL anchor used a trailing slash (`...update/x1/`); 6.0.4 dropped it. Port uses prefix-match on `...firmware/update` to survive both shapes plus any future minor adjustments. Also dropped the `dependsOn(creditsPatch)` from the 5.3.5 source — the `creditsPatch` is one of the 34 missing patches we didn't carry forward.

**Expected behaviour:**

- No user-visible UI change.
- `adb logcat` should not show the OTA URL being contacted on cold launch (or the launch should show a connection-refused on 127.0.0.1).
- Manifest dump (`aapt dump permissions`) should report zero ad-ID permission declarations.

**Risk:** Low. Both patches are anchored on string contents (manifest attribute values + smali const-string), neither touches R8-mangled class letters. Resource patches don't have ART verifier complications.

**Verification chain (per `project_bannerhub_revanced_privacy_hardening.md`):** CI green → grep SEVERE = 0 → "succeeded" line count = 9 → artifact-grep on `apk-Normal` (manifest has 0 ad-ID permissions, smali has the loopback URL override at the right index, lib/ has no JieLi sos) → user device test.

### 2026-05-13 — Plan 6 N/A + Plan 8 inventory complete (3 portable findings)

**Plan 6 (Bugly) is not applicable to 6.0.4.** Recon against `gamehub_604_decompile/`: no `com/tencent/bugly/` smali tree, no Bugly manifest entries, no `initCrashReport` call sites. XiaoJi appears to rely entirely on Firebase Crashlytics for crash reporting (already neutralized by the existing `DisableCrashlyticsPatch`). My earlier "Bugly is likely bundled" was a guess from the typical "Chinese app bundles Bugly" assumption — recon refuted it. Plan 6 is now marked N/A in the privacy-hardening memory file.

**Plan 8 inventory complete.** Diff of `origin/playday-build` (5.3.5, 51 patches) vs `origin/gamehub-604-build` (6.0.4, 31 patches) showed **34 patches not carried forward**. Walked through the 5 most privacy-flavored candidates and verified each against the 6.0.4 decompile:

| 5.3.5 patch | 6.0.4 verdict |
|---|---|
| `DisableAnalyticsPatch` (native-lib stripping for Umeng/Alibaba crash/Alibaba phone-auth + Ad-ID perm strip) | ❌ Native libs `libumeng-spy.so` / `libucrash*.so` / `libumonitor.so` / `libalicomphonenumberauthsdk_core.so` all gone in 6.0.4 (XiaoJi swapped analytics backends in KMP rewrite). ✅ But the 3 `<uses-permission>` declarations for `AD_ID` / `ACCESS_ADSERVICES_ATTRIBUTION` / `ACCESS_ADSERVICES_AD_ID` are STILL declared in 6.0.4 manifest — strip subset is **directly portable** and strengthens Plan 4. |
| `DisableHeartbeatPatch` (returns `WineGameUsageTracker.start/update/end Heartbeat` early) | ⚠️ `WineGameUsageTracker` class gone, BUT the heartbeat code was split into 4-5 obfuscated single-purpose classes in 6.0.4: `smali_classes4/feo.smali` carries `"heartbeat/game/start"`, `heo.smali` carries `"heartbeat/game/update"`, `aeo.smali` carries `"heartbeat/game/end"`, `se7.smali` carries `"heartbeat/game/getUserPlayTimeList"`, plus `smali_classes5/b30.smali` (probable cloud-game variant). **Heartbeat-string anchor still resolves** — can rewrite the patch with structural body-contains-`heartbeat/game/*`-string anchor. **High-value privacy port** (kills periodic per-game telemetry beacons during gameplay). |
| `DisablePushPatch` (strips JPush — `cn.jpush.*`) | ❌ JPush not bundled in 6.0.4 (XiaoJi switched from JPush to Mob Push in the 5.x → 6.x rewrite). Already killed by Plan 5. Naturally obsolete. |
| `DisableCloudTimerPatch` (cloud-gaming timer check skip) | ⚠️ Not privacy-relevant — out of scope. |
| `DisableOtaUpdatesPatch` (replaces OTA URL register with `http://127.0.0.1`) | ✅ URL `https://www.xiaoji.com/firmware/update/x1` still present at `smali_classes4/ki4.smali:6451` inside `ki4.d(String, String, I, ci3)Ljava/lang/Object;` (suspending fn). **Direct port viable** with one caveat: 5.3.5 anchor used trailing slash (`...update/x1/`), 6.0.4 string omits it — port needs `firstMethod("https://www.xiaoji.com/firmware/update/x1")` with no trailing slash. Also surfaced gamepad-firmware OTA path (`smali_classes4/ej3.smali` / `GamepadOtaIntent`) for optional separate neutralization. |

**Net result: 3 portable findings** (Ad-ID strip, OTA URL kill, heartbeat strip), grouped into 2 branches:

- **Branch 1 — `feature/strip-privacy-permissions-ota`** (8a + 8b together) — both fast direct ports, ~60 min total.
  - 8a `StripAdIdPermissionsPatch.kt` (resourcePatch) — removes 3 ad-ID `<uses-permission>` declarations.
  - 8b `DisableOtaUpdatesPatch.kt` (bytecodePatch) — port of 5.3.5 patch with prefix-without-slash fix.
- **Branch 2 — `feature/disable-heartbeat`** (8c) — recon de-risked it from 1-3h to ~60-90 min since all 5 target classes are mapped. Port pending.

After both: Plans 1+7 (analytics-event redirect through Worker) → Plan 9 (`PRIVACY.md`).

Plans 2 + 3 still skipped (low value vs. effort).

Detailed plan inventory, methodology, and the full 34-patch missing list (including non-privacy QoL patches for future workstreams) lives in auto-memory at `project_bannerhub_revanced_privacy_hardening.md`.

### 2026-05-13 — Plan 5 MERGED to `gamehub-604-build`

`feature/disable-mob-push` (head `503204a`) merged into `gamehub-604-build` at merge commit `282c9ea` (`--no-ff` so the pre1 → pre2 anchor-fix history is preserved under the merge). Post-merge sanity build queued as run 25825313855.

Status after this merge: Plans 4 + 5 of the privacy hardening series are both live on `gamehub-604-build`. Remaining: Plans 1+7 (analytics-event redirect), Plan 6 (Bugly), Plan 8 (5.3.5 inventory), Plan 9 (PRIVACY.md). Plans 2 + 3 deliberately skipped (low value vs effort). Cross-cutting inventory + decisions log: auto-memory `project_bannerhub_revanced_privacy_hardening.md`.

### 2026-05-13 — Plan 4 artifact-grep verification (post-merge sanity)

Downloaded `apk-Normal` artifact from CI run 25821952000 (the original `feature/disable-firebase-analytics` artifact build), decoded with apktool, grepped `AndroidManifest.xml`. All three injected `<meta-data>` entries confirmed present under `<application>`:

- `firebase_analytics_collection_deactivated = "true"`
- `google_analytics_adid_collection_enabled = "false"`
- `google_analytics_ssaid_collection_enabled = "false"`

Plan 4 verification chain now complete: source → CI green → device-verified by user → merge sanity build green (run 25822790159) → artifact manifest-grep confirmed patch landed.

### 2026-05-13 — Plan 5 pre1 → pre2 fix (BaseAndroidApp anchor)

`feature/disable-mob-push` pre1 (CI run 25823321334) reported overall CI green but had **0/9 variants actually apply the patch** — all 9 SEVERE-failed silently with `app.revanced.patcher.patch.PatchException: Could not find instruction index`. The CI summary read green because revanced-cli's per-patch SEVERE failures don't propagate to the overall job exit code (same anti-pattern as the menu-injection playbook). **Lesson: always grep CI logs for `SEVERE` even when conclusion is success.**

Root cause: Mob init calls in `BaseAndroidApp.smali` live in the helper method `a()V` (called from `onCreate`), not in `onCreate` itself. The pre1 anchor used `name == "onCreate"` which matched the empty 5-line delegating `onCreate` at line 350 of the smali. `indexOfFirstInstructionOrThrow` then found no `submitPolicyGrantResult` invoke in that method and bailed the entire patch.

Fix in `503204a`: switched the BaseAndroidApp anchor to the same structural body-contains-invoke pattern already used for the nt5 hook. Method name (`a`/`b`/etc.) becomes irrelevant; survives R8 reshuffles on minor bumps.

Pre2 build (CI run 25824684180) verification:

- ✅ 0 SEVERE lines across all 9 variant jobs
- ✅ `"Disable Mob Push tracking" succeeded` on 9/9 variants
- ✅ Manifest in apk-Normal: all 12 `com.mob.*` / `cn.fly.*` components carry `android:enabled="false"` (MobProvider, FlyProvider, MobIDActivity, MobIDService, FlyIDActivity, FlyIDService, MobPushJobService, MobPushActivity, MobLReceiver, NotifyActionReceiver, FCMFirebaseInstanceIdService, FCMFireMessagingReceiver)
- ✅ `BaseAndroidApp.smali` has **0** residual `Lcom/mob/` references (both `submitPolicyGrantResult` and `addPushReceiverInMain` removed)
- ✅ `nt5.smali` has 0 `submitPolicyGrantResult` references; the 4 intentionally-preserved downstream calls (`setClickNotificationToLaunchMainActivity`, `getRegistrationId`, `restartPush` ×2) are still present, ready to no-op against the dormant SDK
- ⚠ 2 `submitPolicyGrantResult` invokes remain inside `com/mob/MobSDK.smali` itself — these are Mob's own internal recursive calls (MobSDK methods calling each other). They're dead code since nothing external can reach MobSDK anymore. Correct behaviour, not a leak.

### 2026-05-13 — feature/disable-mob-push — Plan 5 of the privacy hardening list

Plan 4 (`feature/disable-firebase-analytics`) device-confirmed and merged to `gamehub-604-build` at merge commit `178c5ec` (--no-ff). Post-merge sanity build queued as run 25822790159.

**Plan 5 recon (gamehub_604_decompile/):**

- Mob SDK bundled at `smali_classes3/com/mob/` — full surface: core, pushsdk, plugins (fcm/honor/huawei/meizu/oppo/vivo/xiaomi), commons, tools, mgs. Plus `cn.fly.commons` (Mob's analytics submodule, same vendor).
- XiaoJi-side init call sites found:
  - `smali/com/xiaoji/egggame/BaseAndroidApp.smali` line 29 — `Lcom/mob/MobSDK;->submitPolicyGrantResult(Z)V` (consent gate, `v2=true`)
  - `smali/com/xiaoji/egggame/BaseAndroidApp.smali` line 247 — `Lcom/mob/pushsdk/MobPush;->addPushReceiverInMain(Context, MobPushReceiver)V`
  - `smali_classes4/nt5.smali` method `N(Landroid/content/Context;)V` line 3352 — second `submitPolicyGrantResult` call followed by 4 downstream Mob calls (`setClickNotificationToLaunchMainActivity`, `getRegistrationId`, two `restartPush` inside a `:try_start_0 .. .catchall :catchall_0` wrapper)
- Manifest auto-init surface: `<provider android:name="com.mob.MobProvider">` is the critical one — ContentProviders bootstrap before `Application.onCreate`, so bytecode-only neutralization is insufficient. Manifest layer is required.

**Patch:** `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/misc/analytics/DisableMobPushPatch.kt`. Single user-facing patch ("Disable Mob Push tracking") with two layers:

- **Layer B — `disableMobPushManifestPatch` (private `resourcePatch`)**: scans `<application>` for `<provider>/<service>/<receiver>/<activity>` whose `android:name` starts with `com.mob.` or `cn.fly.` and sets `android:enabled="false"`. Removes Mob/cn.fly `<meta-data>` outright (no enabled attribute supported).
- **Layer A — `disableMobPushPatch` (`bytecodePatch`, depends on the manifest patch)**: removes the 3 init invocations in reverse-index order, verifier-safe because all three are void-returning singles with no `move-result`. `BaseAndroidApp.onCreate` is anchored by stable class name. The nt5 helper is anchored **structurally** (single-arg `Context` parameter, void return, contains a `submitPolicyGrantResult` invoke, NOT `BaseAndroidApp`) so the patch survives R8 reshuffles on future minor bumps.
- Downstream calls in `nt5.N` (`setClickNotificationToLaunchMainActivity`, `getRegistrationId`, `restartPush` x2) intentionally left in place — without the policy grant the SDK stays dormant and these calls either no-op or throw the kind of NPE the existing `:try_start_0/.catchall` already eats. Surgically removing them mid-method would break the try-catch label structure for no functional gain.

**Expected behavior:** Mob Push delivery dies (no inbound notifications from XiaoJi). MobID device-ID collection dies. Mob's `cn.fly` analytics dies. FCM (used by Mob as a delivery layer) is also disabled at the `FCMFirebaseInstanceIdService` registration — pure Firebase FCM is untouched if anything else uses it, but XiaoJi doesn't appear to. No user-facing UI change.

**Verification plan:** post-patch device test should show `adb logcat | grep -iE 'mob|pushsdk'` empty on cold launch, and `tcpdump` should show zero egress to Mob endpoints.

### 2026-05-13 — feature/disable-firebase-analytics — Plan 4 of the privacy hardening list

User asked for the privacy hardening plan; Plan 4 (Disable Firebase Analytics manifest kill-switch) selected as first action because it's the highest ROI per hour.

**Recon (against `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/gamehub_604_decompile/`):**

- `com/google/firebase/analytics`, `crashlytics`, `messaging`, `installations`, `sessions`, `auth`, `datatransport` smali trees all present.
- ⚠ **`com/google/firebase/remoteconfig` present** — but `grep -rE 'Lcom/google/firebase/remoteconfig/' --include='*.smali'` against everything *outside* the Firebase SDK tree returns **0 hits**. Remote Config is a transitive dependency that XiaoJi's own code never invokes — safe to ship the strong `firebase_analytics_collection_deactivated=true` flag without breaking anything.
- Firebase In-App Messaging is **not bundled** (no `inappmessaging` smali path).
- FCM is bundled but used by **Mob Push** as a delivery layer (`com.mob.pushsdk.plugins.fcm.FCMFirebaseInstanceIdService`) — Analytics-deactivation flag does not affect FCM behavior. Mob Push neutralization is a separate Plan-5 work item.

**Patch:** `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/misc/analytics/DisableFirebaseAnalyticsPatch.kt`. Resource patch (manifest-only, no bytecode), modeled on `VibrationManifestPatch` for the DOM-edit pattern. Adds three `<meta-data>` entries to `<application>`:

1. `firebase_analytics_collection_deactivated = true` — Firebase's strongest kill switch (stops SDK init entirely, not just data emission).
2. `google_analytics_adid_collection_enabled = false` — kills Google Ads ID (gAID) collection.
3. `google_analytics_ssaid_collection_enabled = false` — kills SSAID (Android ID) collection.

Each is guarded by a duplicate-check so the patch is idempotent across re-runs and won't collide with any upstream-declared key. ReVanced auto-discovers the new `@Suppress("unused") val disableFirebaseAnalyticsPatch = ...` via Kotlin reflection at patcher-build time — no patch-registry edit required.

**Expected behavior:** zero user-facing change. Background: no events sent to `app-measurement.com`; XiaoJi's Firebase Analytics dashboard loses all patched-APK telemetry. All gameplay, library, components, Wine, Steam launches, controller input, framegen, vibration, etc. are unaffected (none touch Analytics).

**Reversibility:** delete the patch file, rebuild. No bytecode, no state to migrate.

### 2026-05-13 — README top-of-page "separate projects + use at own risk" disclaimer

Per user: warning text covering "Does not replace current Bannerhub 3.7.x (built from Gamehub revanced 5.3.5 by PlayDay) or Bannerhub Lite (built from Gamehub Lite 5.1.4 by Producdevity); Bannerhub, Bannerhub Lite and Bannerhub v6 are SEPARATE projects! NOT to be updated over by any of the other projects! Keep in mind Bannerhub v6 is still a work in progress and will frequently re-release as new base Gamehub versions come out from the original developers. Compatibility is different, so don't expect all games that work on one to work on v6, it uses a new component system and steam clients, thus far, barely tested in general! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!"

Rendered as a prominent `> ## ⚠️ Important — please read before installing` blockquote with an embedded H2 header inside the quote so the warning is impossible to miss. Structure:

1. Lead sentence — "BannerHub v6 does NOT replace BannerHub 3.7.x or BannerHub Lite — they are SEPARATE projects."
2. 3-row bullet list — BannerHub 3.7.x (PlayDay / 5.3.5), BannerHub Lite (Producdevity / Lite 5.1.4), BannerHub v6 (this repo / 6.0.x).
3. Update-incompatibility paragraph — each ships its own package names + keystore + component/Steam backend; Android rejects in-place updates between them; uninstall first.
4. Work-in-progress paragraph — frequent re-releases as XiaoJi pushes new bases; new component system + Steam clients; barely tested in general.
5. Closing **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

Placed between the `---` separator (line 27) and the `**What it does**` paragraph so it's the first body content readers hit after the hero (logo + title + Discord + nav). Preserved user's emphatic capitalisation (SEPARATE, NOT, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK) and brand-name spelling (PlayDay, Producdevity).

### 2026-05-13 — README Credits flattened into a single table

Per user: "Tighten up the credits as a table, neat and tidy."

Collapsed the five sub-sections (Translation & emulation layers, Graphics drivers, Host app, Patching framework, BannerHub-specific upstream) into one flat 3-column markdown table — columns: **Project** (linked) | **Role** | **Maintainer(s)**. Same 8 entries (DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, Box64, FEX-Emu/FEXCore, Mesa Turnip, XiaoJi GameHub, ReVanced, TideGear vibration fix). Mesa Turnip row also lists the three Adreno forks BannerHub serves (Banners-Turnip, StevenMXZ, whitebelyash) inline rather than in a separate paragraph. Lead-in shortened to 1 paragraph; Discord callout retained; closing italic correction-request line retained.

### 2026-05-13 — README Credits section added at bottom

Per user: "now we need to add a credit section at the bottom, listing developers for dxvk, vkd3d, mesa turnip drivers, box64, fexcore, The Gamehub Team, Revanced project to start, if you do not have links I will provide them later we just need a section laid out to start"

New `## Credits` section inserted between `## Releases` and `## License`, plus `10. Credits` entry added to TOC (License bumped to 11). Section is grouped into five sub-headings — Translation & emulation layers (DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, Box64, FEX-Emu/FEXCore), Graphics drivers (Mesa Turnip + Banners-Turnip/StevenMXZ/whitebelyash forks), Host app (XiaoJi GameHub), Patching framework (ReVanced), BannerHub-specific upstream (TideGear/GameHub-Vibration-Fix). Each entry has the project name, a one-line role description, the maintainer(s), and a GitHub / project link.

Confidence on the links I baked in:
- HIGH: doitsujin/dxvk, HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton, ptitSeb/box64, FEX-Emu/FEX, FEX-Emu/FEX-ppa, mesa3d.org, gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa, revanced.app, github.com/revanced, gamehubglobal.com (already linked elsewhere in README), TideGear/GameHub-Vibration-Fix (also already linked).
- The412Banner-internal: Banners-Turnip, StevenMXZ, whitebelyash GH org links pulled from memory `feedback_bannerhub_api_driver_prefixes.md` — confident but the user can correct if any are wrong.

Opening paragraph keeps tone humble ("almost nothing under the hood here is our work"); closing italic line invites corrections; Discord invite callout invites people to ask to be added/corrected/removed. Designed to be extensible — user will provide more names/links in future turns and they slot into the existing sub-headings.

### 2026-05-13 — README Repo layout removed, Table of contents added at top

Per user: "can the repo layout section be removed and replaced at the top with a table of contents?"

- Dropped the entire `## Repo layout` section (~36 lines of per-file annotations under `patches/`, `extensions/`, `native/`, `keystore/`, `assets/`, `.github/workflows/`). The same info is reachable via `git ls-files` + the per-patch source comments and is one more thing to keep in lockstep with reality on every feature add — better not to claim it from the README.
- New `## Table of contents` section inserted between the in-place-updates callout and `## AI Disclaimer`. 10 entries with GitHub auto-generated anchors: `#ai-disclaimer`, `#whats-new-in-v110-604`, `#what-this-is`, `#source`, `#variants`, `#signing`, `#patches-applied`, `#build-it-yourself`, `#releases`, `#license`. The existing quick-jump nav bar at the very top (Discord badge + Patches/Signing/Build/AI-disclaimer chips) is unchanged — TOC is the full structured index, nav bar is the discovery shortcut for the most popular sections.

### 2026-05-13 — README AI Disclaimer expanded with pipeline detail

Per user: "rewrite the disclaimer to explain it is used to help decompile and analyze Game Hub release apks using termux and termux package tool, the map out the apk contents and help write/rewrite new/old revanced patches from Gamehub 5.3.5 revanced project. I am sure anything in that disclaimer you can correct for me I missed"

Rewrote the disclaimer into a lead-in paragraph + three bulleted pipeline stages + a closing manual-verification paragraph:

- **Lead-in:** GameHub is closed-source; all work happens at bytecode level.
- **Decompile & analyse:** Termux + `pkg`-installed apktool on the Android phone; Claude maps R8 letters, Compose resources, manifest deltas; analysis lives in `gamehub_reports/`.
- **Write / rewrite patches:** new patches + ports forward from the **GameHub 5.3.5 ReVanced project**; R8 reshuffles every minor bump (6.0.0 → 6.0.1 → 6.0.2 → 6.0.4) so structural anchors get re-derived per release; patches in Kotlin against ReVanced patcher API + `.rve` Java extensions for fiddly edits.
- **Build & iterate:** GitHub Actions CI only, never local builds (per `feedback_build_method.md`); 9-variant matrix; artefacts pulled to phone for device test.
- **Manual verification (closing paragraph):** rooted + unrooted devices; logcat via the `getlog` Magisk helper (linked to The412Banner/logcat-bridge) on rooted, `adb logcat` on unrooted, plus in-app debug log files from the `Debug logging` patch. No stable cut until verified on hardware.

Kept the user's first-person voice ("by me", "my Android phone") and preserved "Claude AI Sonnet 4.6" verbatim from the user's disclaimer text (the model the user specified — not autocorrected to the runtime model).

### 2026-05-13 — Plan 8c local-tracker SHELVED → pure-stub variant on feature/disable-heartbeat

User reported in-game perf cost from pre3 local tracker even though privacy goal was met. Path-1 (local tracker) preserves the in-app playtime UI by recording sessions to `bh_playtime_prefs.xml` with reflection-based `Lekf;` construction; that's per-tick JSON encode + SharedPreferences disk write + a warm reflection cache. Path-2 (pure stub) throws the UI feature away in exchange for zero per-tick cost.

**Archive:** tagged `archive/plan8c-local-tracker-pre3` at `975c4b1` (push acknowledged by origin). Branch `feature/disable-heartbeat-local-tracker` left in place; the tag is the durable anchor.

**New patch:** `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/misc/analytics/DisableHeartbeatPatch.kt` on fresh branch `feature/disable-heartbeat` off `gamehub-604-build` @ `2d4e779`. Sibling to other privacy patches (matches Plans 4/5/8a/8b convention). Four `firstMethod {}` blocks reuse the body-contains-string anchors from the recon (`heartbeat/game/start`, `…/update`, `…/end`, `…/getUserPlayTimeList`) so anchor stability across R8 reshuffles is preserved. Smali snippets:

```smali
# invokeSuspend bodies (Lfeo / Lheo / Laeo)
sget-object v0, Lkotlin/Unit;->INSTANCE:Lkotlin/Unit;
return-object v0

# Lse7;->c  (getUserPlayTimeList)
new-instance v0, Ljava/util/ArrayList;
invoke-direct {v0}, Ljava/util/ArrayList;-><init>()V
new-instance v1, Ln55;
invoke-direct {v1, v0}, Ln55;-><init>(Ljava/lang/Object;)V
return-object v1
```

No extension classes, no resource patch, no dependencies on `sharedGamehubExtensionPatch`. UI iterator over the empty list runs zero passes → no ClassCastException risk (the failure mode that bit pre1/pre2 of the local-tracker variant).

Trade-off accepted by user: in-app playtime display will be empty. Local-tracker tag stays available for revival if users request the feature back.

### 2026-05-13 — Plan 8c Path 2 (pure stub) installed on device; verification in progress

User installed `BannerHub-V6-1.1.0-604-stub-pre1-Patched-Normal.apk` (pre1 from `feature/disable-heartbeat` @ `a050b33`, [run 25837778671](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25837778671)) **over** the existing Path 1 local-tracker install (`1.3.0-604-playtime-pre2`). APK is in `/storage/emulated/0/Download/apk-Normal (2)/`, SHA-256 `5df7f80f09b83ad70a0c41d76c494997430ca98ef591f691b6a06b80726b2018`.

**Install evidence (without root-side `/data/app` access):**
- `/data/data/banner.hub/files/profileinstaller_profileWrittenFor_lastUpdateTime.dat` mtime → `2026-05-13 22:24` — ProfileInstaller writes this once per APK install/update, so it's a reliable install timestamp.
- `bh_playtime_prefs.xml` last mtime → `2026-05-13 22:05` (DOOMBLADE session `dur:517`, started before update). **Frozen** since the Path 2 install; no further heartbeats written.
- Post-update launch at 22:26 wrote `pc_g_setting63362.xml`, `sp_winemu_unified_resources.xml`, `com.google.android.gms.measurement.prefs.xml` — but **NOT** `bh_playtime_prefs.xml`. First positive signal.

**Cross-check on the APK on disk** (Downloads copy, assumed identical to installed):
- All 9 classesN.dex scanned — **zero hits** for `BhPlayTimeTracker` or `bh_playtime_prefs` strings, confirming Path 1's extension class is gone.
- Compare against Path 1 pre2 APK on the same device: 4 dex files contain `Lapp/revanced/extension/gamehub/playtime/BhPlayTimeTracker;`. Clear delta.

**Pending definitive test** (cannot complete from PRoot side):
1. User launches a Wine game from BannerHub.
2. Plays for ≥60s (Path 1 ticked heartbeat every 30s; Path 2 should tick zero).
3. Re-check `getlog --ls /data/data/banner.hub/shared_prefs/bh_playtime_prefs.xml` mtime.
4. **Pass:** mtime still `2026-05-13 22:05`. **Fail:** mtime advances (would mean Path 1 still resident somehow).

**Why root-side `/data/app/.../base.apk` isn't readable**: logcat-bridge allowlist excludes `/data/app/`. The Downloads copy + ProfileInstaller timestamp + prefs-mtime delta are the workable triangulation when the installed APK itself is out of reach. Recording this as the reference recipe for future "what's installed?" checks.

Branch state unchanged: `feature/disable-heartbeat` @ `a050b33` still the head. Once verification passes, the merge to `gamehub-604-build` is the only remaining step before this plan ships.

### 2026-05-13 — Plan 8c Path 2 (pure stub) DEVICE-CONFIRMED + merging to gamehub-604-build

User ran DOOMBLADE for several minutes after the 22:24 install. Re-checked `bh_playtime_prefs.xml` at ~23:02:

- **mtime: `2026-05-13 22:05`** — unchanged from pre-install. Stale Path 1 data preserved (last session `dur:517`), zero new writes during gameplay.
- Meanwhile the rest of the app was clearly active:
  - `pc_g_setting63362.xml` (DOOMBLADE config) → 22:26 (2 min after install)
  - `sp_winemu_unified_resources.xml` (Winlator registry) → 22:59
  - `com.google.android.gms.measurement.prefs.xml` → 23:02
  - Directory `.` mtime → 23:02

That's the definitive signal: heartbeat start/update/end paths produce zero side effects during a real gameplay session. Pure stub fully neutralizes the telemetry without the per-tick JSON encode + SharedPreferences write + reflection cost of Path 1.

**Merging `feature/disable-heartbeat` → `gamehub-604-build` (--no-ff).**

#### Path 1 (local tracker) — preserved for future revival

The Path 1 variant (which keeps the in-app playtime UI working by routing heartbeat ticks into a local `BhPlayTimeTracker` instead of the XiaoJi network call) is **NOT being deleted**. It remains fully recoverable:

- **Branch:** `feature/disable-heartbeat-local-tracker` @ `975c4b1` (local + origin)
- **Tag:** `archive/plan8c-local-tracker-pre3` (durable anchor — branches can be force-pushed, tags shouldn't be)
- **Files it ships** (entirely separate from Path 2's filenames, so the two never collide on the filesystem):
  - `extensions/.../gamehub/playtime/BhPlayTimeTracker.java` (300 lines — the runtime tracker)
  - `patches/.../gamehub/playtime/DisableHeartbeatLocalTrackerPatch.kt` (162 lines — the patch wiring it in)

If a user (or batch of users) later requests the in-app playtime UI back, the path is: revert the Path 2 merge, then merge `feature/disable-heartbeat-local-tracker`. Or cherry-pick its two source files onto a fresh branch if we want both variants offered as separate patches users can toggle in `revanced-cli --include`. Either way, no rebuild from scratch needed.

### 2026-05-13 — Legacy GLES2 renderer toggle — DRAFTED, NOT STARTED (shelved pending perf data)

User asked whether a ReVanced patch could re-implement GameHub 6.0.2's GLES2 renderer as a toggle in 6.0.4, after we walked through the byte-level renderer rewrite documented in `gamehub_reports/GAMEHUB_600_MASTER_MAP.md` § 26.23. Scoping captured here so we can pick it back up later.

**Background.** 6.0.2 ran an OpenGL ES 2.0 + EGL renderer in `libxserver.so` with an `ASurfaceTransaction` plane compositor for the cursor in `libwinemu.so`. 6.0.4 replaced both with a Vulkan compositor (four backends registered: `winemu-xserver`, `winemu-flip`, `winemu-vk`, `lorie-vk`; cursor folded into the Vulkan path under `g.cursor.ds`). The Vulkan path is what makes AI frame-gen and the libGameScopeVK ICD chain work — the SPIR-V HDR tone-map shaders shipped as dead-weight assets in 6.0.2 and only went live in 6.0.4 once the consumer existed.

**Architectural verdict: feasible.** Every individual technique required has shipped on `gamehub-604-build` already:

| Step | Existing precedent |
|---|---|
| Bundle additional `.so` files in `lib/arm64-v8a/` | Vibration patch ships `libevshim.so` |
| Smali `System.loadLibrary` hook to route by SharedPreferences flag | Standard smali patching |
| Restore deleted `DirectRendering` Java class as smali stubs | Unsafe.allocateInstance + Proxy patterns from menu-injection playbook (pre7→pre17 trail) |
| Conditionally short-circuit `XServer.setFlipEnabled(Z)V` + `onFlipStateChanged(Z)V` | Standard smali branch insertion |
| Settings UI row for the toggle | Menu-injection playbook (`Lx57.a()` + `Lpzc.j0()`) |

**Real blockers (technical, not patcher-side).**

1. **libwinemu pairing.** The 6.0.2 GLES2 path depends on the `ASurfaceTransaction*` plane-compositor symbols that live in 6.0.2's `libwinemu.so` — but that libwinemu also contains unrelated 6.0.3/6.0.4 fixes (input, audio, controller, etc.). Running it may regress those. **Unanswered until a load-test build runs.**
2. **JNI symbol drift.** Restored `DirectRendering` smali stubs must match the exact JNI signatures the 6.0.2 libxserver expects to call back into. Each missing method = crash class.
3. **Frame-gen + libGameScopeVK + HDR tone-mapping go inert** in legacy mode. Release notes would need to explain the trade-off; users opting in lose the Vulkan-only features.
4. **APK size +~5 MB** for the two bundled libs.
5. **revanced-cli SEVERE-doesn't-fail-CI anti-pattern.** Per menu-injection playbook — CI step would need explicit log scanning so a partial patch failure can't ship green.

**Proposed first milestone if/when this resumes.**

Before building the toggle, prove the 6.0.2 lib pair even loads under 6.0.4's Kotlin/runtime:

- Branch: `feature/legacy-gles2-renderer` off `gamehub-604-build` (per branch-per-patch workflow).
- Patch class: `LegacyGles2RendererPatch.kt`.
- Asset drop + smali loadLibrary hook with a **hardcoded "always legacy" flag** (no SharedPreferences, no UI).
- CI build → device install → does it launch? Does any game render?
- If it crashes on launch or every game black-screens → toggle work is moot, close the branch.
- Only if step above passes: add SharedPreferences toggle + Settings UI row + per-game override.

**Why it's on the shelf.** No perf data yet showing GLES2 would actually win on any device class. Vulkan-on-Adreno is generally lower-overhead; the legitimate revisit triggers are (a) a device class reports clear Vulkan-renderer regressions (Mali-G57-class, pre-Adreno-6xx, Helio-G99 territory), or (b) a specific game family demonstrably runs better under GLES2.

**Fallback if the toggle isn't worth the effort.** Ship a separate "BannerHub Legacy GLES2" variant built off the 6.0.2 APK base — same pattern as the PuBG variant pinned at 5.3.5. No dual-lib bundling, no JNI shim work, no toggle UI. Trade-off: separate install, not a setting.

**Status.** No branch created. No code written. Memory entry at `project_bannerhub_revanced_legacy_gles2_renderer.md` carries the same scope so the concept survives across sessions.

### 2026-05-13 — Plans 1+7+GMS Measurement recon (work scheduled for tomorrow)

After merging Plan 8c Path 2, ran recon for the three remaining privacy items so tomorrow's session opens with concrete patch shapes.

#### Plan 1 — analytics-event host redirect (APK side)

Source of the host list: `RedirectCatalogApiPatch.kt:51-53` already documents what it deliberately left untouched. The analytics-event hosts are `landscape-api-*-*.vgabc.com/events`. Grepped the 6.0.4 decompile at `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/gamehub_604_decompile/` and found **two** smali files with these strings:

**File 1: `smali_classes4/cx5.smali`** — general analytics events. Standard if-eqz environment switch:

```
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG)               host = "https://dev2-gamehub-api.vgabc.com/events"               (line 630)
else if (Lz40;->b == Lesj;->d /*Beta*/)
                                     host = "https://landscape-api-beta.vgabc.com/events"             (line 650)
else                                 host = "https://statistic-gamehub-api.vgabc.com/events"          (line 658)  ← PRODUCTION
```

**File 2: `smali_classes4/nh4.smali`** — device-performance-config sub-endpoint. Same switch shape:

```
                                     "https://dev2-gamehub-api.vgabc.com/events/device-performance-config"               (line 183)
                                     "https://landscape-api-beta.vgabc.com/events/device-performance-config"             (line 203)
                                     "https://statistic-gamehub-api.vgabc.com/events/device-performance-config"          (line 211)  ← PRODUCTION
```

**The production analytics host is `statistic-gamehub-api.vgabc.com`** — distinct from the catalog hosts (`landscape-api-{cn,oversea}.vgabc.com`) that the existing catalog redirect already swapped. So this is genuinely new traffic; not double-covered.

**Patch shape.** Two `bytecodePatch { ... }` blocks (one per file), each using the same `indexOfFirstInstructionOrThrow { CONST_STRING && StringReference == X }` find-and-replace as `RedirectCatalogApiPatch`. Belt-and-braces option: swap all 6 const-strings (3 in each file) — that way even if a future Beta-flag flip occurred, traffic stays inside the Worker. Cheap; recommended.

R8 letters to track for future base bumps: `Lcx5;` and `Lnh4;` will rename. Anchor by string content (`statistic-gamehub-api.vgabc.com/events`), not by class letter — same pattern as the privacy-hardening playbook.

#### Plan 7 — Worker `/events/*` route (Cloudflare Worker side)

Inspected `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/bannerhub-api/bannerhub-worker.js` (1203 lines).

- Entry point: `async fetch(request, env, ctx)` at line 495.
- 6.0 client gate strips `/v6/` prefix to `is60=true` (line 505-508).
- OPTIONS preflight handler at line 521.
- Routes follow `if (url.pathname === '/foo') return handleFoo(...)` early-return pattern.
- Catch-all fallback at line 1167: `fetch(${GAMEHUB_API}${url.pathname}${url.search}, ...)` — this is the layer that would forward analytics events to XiaoJi if we did nothing.

**Insertion point.** Between line 525 (OPTIONS return) and line 528 (`const time = ...`). Insert:

```js
// Analytics events — Plan 7. Patched APK redirects statistic-gamehub-api.vgabc.com
// here; silently drop with 204 to keep the app's fire-and-forget call from
// retrying. Matches /events and /events/<anything> for current + future paths.
if (url.pathname === '/events' || url.pathname.startsWith('/events/')) {
  return new Response(null, { status: 204, headers: corsHeaders })
}
```

Place BEFORE the catch-all so the path never reaches the GAMEHUB_API forward. corsHeaders is in scope at the insertion point.

**Deploy mechanics.** Per [[project_bannerhub_api_worker]] there's a no-wrangler deploy recipe. Doc cross-link will go into the Plan 7 commit message.

#### Plan 10 — GMS Measurement kill (NEW finding, was not in original plan list)

Pulled `/data/data/banner.hub/shared_prefs/com.google.android.gms.measurement.prefs.xml` via getlog. **Active and writing locally** despite Plan 4 having shipped (Plan 4 disables Firebase Analytics SDK init, but GMS Measurement is a separate Google Play Services component):

```
measurement_enabled_from_api=true
measurement_enabled=true
deferred_analytics_collection=false
session_id=1778690101
app_instance_id=6db38be8b76e59c8d22db2e059ee472c   ← persistent per-install identifier
gmp_app_id=1:304891727788:android:e27ed4a7a22bdbc9adb409
non_personalized_ads=true
consent_settings=G101
dma_consent_settings=-20:0
use_service=true                                     ← routes via AppMeasurementService
```

`use_service=true` means the SDK ships data out via the system-level `AppMeasurementService`. AndroidManifest declares three components (all currently `android:enabled="true"`):

```xml
<receiver android:enabled="true" android:exported="false"
          android:name="com.google.android.gms.measurement.AppMeasurementReceiver"/>
<service  android:enabled="true" android:exported="false"
          android:name="com.google.android.gms.measurement.AppMeasurementService"/>
<service  android:enabled="true" android:exported="false"
          android:name="com.google.android.gms.measurement.AppMeasurementJobService"
          android:permission="android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE"/>
```

**Patch shape (analogous to Plan 5's manifest Layer B).** Resource patch that walks `<application>` and sets `android:enabled="false"` on every `<receiver>`/`<service>` whose name starts with `com.google.android.gms.measurement.`. Three components total in 6.0.4. Same DOM-walk pattern as `DisableMobPushPatch.kt`'s manifest companion.

**Side-finding to verify tomorrow before writing Plan 10.** Grepping `pre2-decoded/AndroidManifest.xml` (last installed APK before today's Path 2) shows **none** of Plan 4's three meta-data entries (`firebase_analytics_collection_deactivated`, `google_analytics_adid_collection_enabled`, `google_analytics_ssaid_collection_enabled`) actually present. Two possibilities:
1. `feature/disable-heartbeat-local-tracker` (the source branch for pre2) branched off `gamehub-604-build` *before* Plan 4's merge `178c5ec` landed, so Plan 4's manifest changes simply weren't carried into this build.
2. Plan 4 silently failed in the build pipeline (the revanced-cli `SEVERE`-without-failure anti-pattern from the menu-injection playbook).

Tomorrow: re-decode the freshly-installed Plan 8c Path 2 APK (downloaded today) and re-check. If still missing, Plan 4 needs a re-verification pass before Plan 10 lands so we don't ship "Plan 10 kills GMS" without confirming Plan 4 actually killed Firebase Analytics.

#### Suggested order tomorrow

1. Verify Plan 4 manifest entries in the freshly-built Path 2 APK (decode `BannerHub-V6-1.1.0-604-stub-pre1-Patched-Normal.apk` from Downloads, grep manifest). If absent → fix Plan 4 first; if present → proceed.
2. Plan 1 + Plan 7 together — they're coupled (Plan 1 alone would let the Worker proxy events to XiaoJi via its catch-all; Plan 7 alone has nothing pointed at it). Branch `feature/disable-analytics-events` for the APK side; Worker change pushed to `bannerhub-api` separately. Coordinated deploy.
3. Plan 10 (GMS Measurement) — separate branch `feature/disable-gms-measurement`. Pure resource patch, no bytecode.
4. Then Plan 9 (PRIVACY.md) — written against the actually-shipped state, including the bigeyes.com image CDN honesty note discussed today.

#### EOD checkpoint — session ends 2026-05-13 evening

State to resume from tomorrow:

- `gamehub-604-build` HEAD = `7f2f851` (this recon commit, pushed).
- Last merged feature = `feature/disable-heartbeat` → merge commit `519ba65` (Plan 8c Path 2, device-confirmed).
- No open branches in flight — all recon lives on `gamehub-604-build` itself.
- **First action tomorrow:** decode `/storage/emulated/0/Download/apk-Normal (2)/BannerHub-V6-1.1.0-604-stub-pre1-Patched-Normal.apk` and grep its `AndroidManifest.xml` for `firebase_analytics_collection_deactivated`. If present → Plan 4 is good, start Plans 1+7. If absent → Plan 4 silently failed in build, fix it first before anything else lands.
- Both Plans 1+7 and Plan 10 have full recon notes above; tomorrow is implementation, not investigation.


### [docs] — README badges expansion (2026-05-14)
**Commit:** `970fa12` on `gamehub-604-build`

Added GitHub downloads badges (total + latest-release) alongside the existing Discord badge in the centered header block. All three badges already in `for-the-badge` style — this was the visual reference used to standardize BannerHub and Bannerhub-Lite the same day. No code changes.


## 2026-05-14 — Privacy series resumes: Plan 4 re-verified, Plan 10 implemented

### Plan 4 re-verification (cleared yesterday's blocker)

Pulled the device-confirmed Plan 8c Path 2 APK from CI run [25837778671](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25837778671) artifact `apk-Normal`. SHA-256 `5df7f80f09b83ad70a0c41d76c494997430ca98ef591f691b6a06b80726b2018` matches the merge-time hash in memory — same APK that was sitting on banner.hub yesterday.

Decoded with `apktool d` and grepped `AndroidManifest.xml`:

| Plan 4 meta-data | Manifest line | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `firebase_analytics_collection_deactivated="true"` | 324 | present |
| `google_analytics_adid_collection_enabled="false"` | 325 | present |
| `google_analytics_ssaid_collection_enabled="false"` | 326 | present |

All three entries land correctly. CI log confirms `"Disable Firebase Analytics" succeeded` on all 9 variants, zero `SEVERE`. Yesterday's "Plan 4 missing" reading was a false negative — most likely a stale decode dir (the user grepped `pre2-decoded/` which was an older artifact decode, not the freshly-built Path 2 APK).

**Bonus spot-checks on the same APK:**
- Plan 5 (Mob Push) — 13 `enabled="false"` entries in manifest, matches expected count for Layer B.
- Plan 8a (Ad-ID perms) — 0 `AD_ID`/`ADSERVICES` permissions present, stripped.
- Plan 10 confirmed needed — lines 252–254 still show `AppMeasurementReceiver`/`Service`/`JobService` with `android:enabled="true"`. GMS is genuinely a separate kill path.

### Plan 10 — Disable GMS Measurement (implementation)

**Branch:** `feature/disable-gms-measurement` off `gamehub-604-build@9e1930e`.

**Patch:** `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/misc/analytics/DisableGmsMeasurementPatch.kt` (57 lines).

Pure resource patch, no bytecode. Walks `<application>` and sets `android:enabled="false"` on exactly three FQCN-matched components:

- `<receiver android:name="com.google.android.gms.measurement.AppMeasurementReceiver">`
- `<service  android:name="com.google.android.gms.measurement.AppMeasurementService">`
- `<service  android:name="com.google.android.gms.measurement.AppMeasurementJobService">`

Shape modeled on Plan 5's `disableMobPushManifestPatch` Layer B, but FQCN-exact instead of prefix-based since the GMS Measurement surface is a fixed three-component set, not an arbitrarily-nested SDK namespace.

**Why pure manifest is sufficient (no bytecode layer):** Unlike Mob Push, GMS Measurement does NOT auto-init via a `<provider>`. The two services are bound on demand by other GMS code (PackageManager registration query); the receiver fires on broadcasts. `android:enabled="false"` makes PackageManager treat each as not-present, so the bound-service lookups return null and broadcasts are filtered out before delivery. No call-site removal needed.

### Plan 10 — pre1 verification + device test

**CI run [25881040284](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25881040284)** — 3m17s, conclusion=success, 0 SEVERE, `"Disable GMS Measurement"` succeeded on all 9 variants, Plan 4 still succeeding (no cross-patch regression). APK SHA-256: `4b330e12261c710f0ded068b2421618fa7809af9a3dfde021b18e2a2c6402d6c`.

Manifest grep on decoded `apk-Normal` (lines 252-254):

```
<receiver android:enabled="false" ... AppMeasurementReceiver/>
<service  android:enabled="false" ... AppMeasurementService/>
<service  android:enabled="false" ... AppMeasurementJobService ... permission=BIND_JOB_SERVICE/>
```

All three flipped at the same line numbers as pre-patch. Surgical edit, no other manifest churn. Plan 4 entries still at 324-326.

### Plan 10 — device test (banner.hub)

**Install:** 2026-05-14 16:19 (`profileinstaller_profileWrittenFor_lastUpdateTime.dat`).

**Usage between baseline and post-test:** game launched + quit (Wine container exercised), app backgrounded for work session, reopened, cycled tabs (home/library), browsed Steam games, online topics, leaderboards. ~30+ minutes of mixed activity including foreground/background cycles.

**Result — `/data/data/banner.hub/shared_prefs/com.google.android.gms.measurement.prefs.xml`:**

| Metric | Baseline | Post-test | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `session_id` | 1778690101 | 1778690101 | frozen |
| `last_pause_time` | 1778692645533 | 1778692645533 | **frozen — decodes to 2026-05-13 22:37 UTC (yesterday's pause)** |
| `health_monitor:start` | 1778748219665 | 1778748219665 | frozen |
| `app_instance_id` | 6db38be8…472c | 6db38be8…472c | unchanged |

**The decisive signal:** `last_pause_time` would normally advance on every pause if GMS Measurement were alive. It hasn't moved despite real pause/resume activity today. **GMS Measurement is no longer recording session events.** ✅

**One mtime curiosity:** file mtime is 16:51 (~30 min after install), but all values are unchanged from baseline. Almost certainly a no-op `SharedPreferences.apply()` during the install transition that touched mtime without changing data. Worth noting but not a failure — data isn't advancing.

**Side-effect check:** game launch, online topics, leaderboards, Steam cards, tab navigation all worked normally. No GMS consumer broke.

### Plan 10 — MERGED to gamehub-604-build

**Merge commit:** `d4675ec` (`--no-ff` of `feature/disable-gms-measurement` into `gamehub-604-build`), 2026-05-14.

`gamehub-604-build` HEAD now `d4675ec`. Privacy plans 4 + 5 + 8a + 8b + 8c-pure-stub + **10** all shipped. Plans 1+7 (analytics-event Worker redirect) next — recon already complete from yesterday.


## 2026-05-14 — Plan 1 reframed as pure client-side stub (Plan 7 dropped)

### Design pivot

Original Plan 1+7 design (yesterday's recon) was to redirect `statistic-gamehub-api.vgabc.com/events*` to the BannerHub Cloudflare Worker and 204 it. User asked whether a simpler local stub would work — the answer is yes, and it's strictly better:

| | Worker redirect (original) | Local stub (chosen) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repos to touch | 2 (revanced + bannerhub-api) | 1 |
| Trust shift | XiaoJi → CF+Me | none |
| Worker invocations | every event burns one | zero |
| Battery / radio wake | one failed connection per event | zero |
| Deploy coordination | yes | none |

The 5.3.5 `DisableOtaUpdatesPatch` (shipped as Plan 8b) already uses a similar `127.0.0.1` URL-rewrite technique, but going one level deeper — stubbing the entire send method to early-return — eliminates even the connection attempt. Plan 7 (Worker `/events/*` route) deleted from the inventory.

### Recon (Lcx5; / Lnh4; / Loh4;)

**Lcx5; (general events `/events`)**
- Single public method: `Lcx5;->a(Ljava/util/Collection;Lci3;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (suspend send-batch).
- Sole external caller: `Lazi;` at smali line 444 — does `check-cast … Lyw5;` on the result.
- Return contract: caller expects `Lyw5;` data class — `(boolean success, Integer code, String msg, Throwable err, int defaultMask)` constructor.
- URLs in body: 3 const-strings (dev2/beta/production); production string is `"https://statistic-gamehub-api.vgabc.com/events"` (no trailing path) — unique enough to anchor on.

**Loh4; (device-performance-config `/events/device-performance-config`)**
- Public method: `Loh4;->b(IJLci3;)Ljava/lang/Object;` — called by 5+ classes (lh4 zz3 xz3 uz3 b04).
- `Loh4;->b` calls `Loh4;->c` which constructs `Lnh4;` (the lambda body) which holds the actual URL strings + HTTP send.
- Caller of `b` (e.g. zz3) does `check-cast … Lxnm;` — `(int, LinkedHashSet)` constructor.
- URLs not directly in `b`'s body — must anchor by class + name + signature `(IJLci3;)Object`.

**Why stub at public methods, not at the URL-containing lambda body** — callers' `check-cast` contracts force a specific concrete return type. Returning Unit.INSTANCE from `Lnh4;->invokeSuspend` would propagate up to `Loh4;->b` which would then crash trying to build a `Lxnm` from a Unit.

### Patch — `StubAnalyticsEventsPatch.kt`

**Branch:** `feature/stub-analytics-events` off `gamehub-604-build@d4675ec`.

Both methods get an `addInstructions(0, …)` prefix that allocates the expected return type and returns immediately. Hardcoded class letters (`Lcx5`, `Loh4`, `Lyw5`, `Lxnm`) with structural anchors (URL-string-in-body for cx5; class+name+signature for oh4). Recipes for re-deriving each letter on a future base bump are in the patch source header comment.

### pre1 — silent assembly bug

CI run [25890397139](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25890397139) reported 0 SEVERE and `"Stub analytics events" succeeded` 9/9. **But the decoded APK revealed only 5 of the 7 stub instructions landed for Lcx5;->a** — the `invoke-direct` constructor call and `return-object v0` were silently dropped.

**Root cause:** Dalvik's `invoke-direct` standard form (format 35c) is capped at **5 registers**. The Lyw5 constructor takes 6 args (Z, Integer, String, Throwable, I + implicit `this` = 6 regs). The smali assembler bailed on the bad instruction at assembly time without raising a SEVERE, and dropped both that line and the subsequent `return-object`. Net result: v0 was left half-initialized (new-instance only, no ctor call) before the original method body's `move-object/from16 v0, p0` clobbered it — so the entire original send path executed.

**Fix in commit `1a2b588`:** swap to `invoke-direct/range {v0 .. v5}` (format 3rc, range form, no register cap). The Lxnm stub on Loh4;->b was correctly assembled in pre1 because that constructor only uses 3 registers — within the format-35c cap.

### pre2 — clean

CI run [25890683302](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25890683302). 0 SEVERE, 9/9 succeeded.

APK SHA-256: `83f52c597faccbdc0f5d2e5d3d36e11811a330247ad0690db23510399b973cda`. Both stubs landed complete in the decoded smali — `new-instance` → const loads → `invoke-direct[/range]` → `return-object v0`, followed by the now-unreachable original method body.

### Active state (2026-05-14 19:17 EDT — checkpoint)

- Branch `feature/stub-analytics-events` at `1a2b588`, pushed.
- pre2 APK installed on banner.hub at 19:12 EDT (`profileinstaller_profileWrittenFor_lastUpdateTime.dat` mtime).
- App not yet exercised — `banner.hub` not running, logcat empty (`getlog -n 10000 banner.hub` returns 0 lines from the app process).
- Awaiting device test: open app, launch a game, browse Steam cards / leaderboards / online topics for ≥5 minutes. Success signal = zero hits for `statistic-gamehub-api.vgabc.com` or `vgabc.com/events` in logcat during the active session.
- Side observation (Plan 10 territory, not Plan 1): `com.google.android.gms.measurement.prefs.xml` mtime advanced from yesterday's 16:51 → today 19:17, even with app not running. Likely GMS system process touching the file. Need to check if values actually changed or just mtime — pending fresh `getlog --cat` after device test.

### Resume checklist if session is lost mid-test

1. Pull latest: `cd /data/data/com.termux/files/home/bannerhub-revanced && git pull && git checkout feature/stub-analytics-events`.
2. APK already installed; if user lost it, re-download via `gh run download 25890683302 --repo The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced --name apk-Normal` (artifacts expire 2026-05-28).
3. Pull a fresh logcat trace: `getlog -n 20000 banner.hub` → output goes to `/home/claude-user/logcat-banner.hub-<timestamp>.txt`.
4. Verify: `grep -c "vgabc.com\|statistic-gamehub\|/events" <logfile>` must be 0.
5. Verify GMS prefs frozen: `getlog --cat /data/data/banner.hub/shared_prefs/com.google.android.gms.measurement.prefs.xml` — `last_pause_time` should still be 1778692645533 (yesterday).
6. If both green → merge `feature/stub-analytics-events` → `gamehub-604-build` with `--no-ff`, push, update memory + progress log + MEMORY.md privacy hook line.
7. Privacy series state post-merge: Plans 4 + 5 + 8a + 8b + 8c-pure-stub + 10 + 1 all shipped. Only Plan 9 (PRIVACY.md) left.

### Plan 1 — device test result + merge (2026-05-14 ~19:35 EDT)

User did a clean install of pre2 APK then ran a full session: launch app, launch a game, play, quit game, exit app. Captured a DNS recorder trace (started before opening the app, stopped after quit) plus a logcat dump in `log_2026_05_14_19_32_26.log` (1029 lines, spans 19:25:56 → 19:32:17 = ~6.5 minutes of post-install activity).

**DNS recorder evidence** (screenshot `Screenshot_20260514-193241.png`): 12 hosts resolved during the session. **`statistic-gamehub-api.vgabc.com` did NOT appear**, nor did the dev2/beta variants. Hosts that did resolve are all expected non-XiaoJi: `firebase-settings.crashlytics.com` (Crashlytics config fetch — its own DNS path, not analytics), `firebaselogging-pa.googleapis.com` (🚫 blocked marker, not from us), `galaxy-log.gog.com` (GOG), `shared.akamai.steamstatic.com` (Steam image CDN), `play.googleapis.com` + `android.apis.google.com` + `firebaseinstallations.googleapis.com` (Play Services + install ID), plus a few system/browser/Claude-side hosts unrelated to BannerHub. Cleanest possible signal — the stub returns before any URL string is allocated, so the HTTP client never asks DNS to resolve those hosts.

**Logcat evidence**: 0 grep hits for `vgabc.com`/`statistic-gamehub`/`/events` across all 1029 log lines. 0 crashes (no FATAL / AndroidRuntime / ClassCastException / ClassNotFound). 414 banner.hub-tagged lines = real heavy in-app activity. `Lazi`'s `check-cast Lyw5;` succeeded silently (our stub-allocated Lyw5 instance accepted); all 5+ callers of `Loh4;->b` got their expected `Lxnm;` back without cast crashes.

**Merge commit:** `b043f8c` (`--no-ff` of `feature/stub-analytics-events` into `gamehub-604-build`).

`gamehub-604-build` HEAD now `b043f8c`. **Privacy plans 4 + 5 + 8a + 8b + 8c-pure-stub + 10 + 1 ALL SHIPPED.** Only Plan 9 (PRIVACY.md) remains — write-up against the actually-shipped state including bigeyes.com / GOG-telemetry / Steam-CDN / Firebase-Settings honesty notes.


## 2026-05-14 — Plan 9 SHIPPED: PRIVACY.md + README link

### What landed

- `PRIVACY.md` at repo root — the public-facing privacy doc covering the full hardening stack.
- `README.md` header — added `Privacy` link to the centered navigation row between `Patches` and `Signing`.

### Structure

1. **What we kill** — table of 8 telemetry channels (Firebase Analytics, Mob Push, AD-ID perms, OTA URL, heartbeat tracker, GMS Measurement, `/events`, `/events/device-performance-config`) with one-line mechanism + merge-commit link per row. All commit hashes verified against `git log --merges` before citing per [[always-verify-never-assume-hard-rule]].
2. **What we deliberately did NOT touch** — `bigeyes.com` (image CDN, Plan 3 deliberately skipped for cost), `firebase-settings.crashlytics.com` (Crashlytics config-fetch leftover, no events upload), `firebaselogging-pa.googleapis.com` (separate logging path; suggested future Plan 11), GOG telemetry, Steam CDN, BannerHub Cloudflare Worker. Each with explicit "what it does / what it leaks / why we kept it" paragraph.
3. **Trust-shift acknowledgement** — explicitly calls out that catalog API still flows through the Worker (so users see CF+The412Banner instead of XiaoJi for that surface), and that Plan 1's redesign closed the analytics half so telemetry has zero trust shift now.
4. **Out of scope** — Steam Cloud, GOG online, EOS, anti-cheat, user save data, Windows games themselves.
5. **Verification recipe** — DNS recorder + logcat + decoded manifest + smali head checks. The same recipe used internally during dev, exposed publicly so users can reproduce.
6. **Issues link** — explicit invitation to report disclosure gaps as bugs.

### Empirical claim cited

The DNS-recorder evidence captured during the Plan 1 device test (full 6.5-min session, zero queries for `statistic-gamehub-api.vgabc.com` or dev2/beta variants) is cited as the empirical confirmation that the table's claims hold on a real device.

### Doc lives directly on `gamehub-604-build`

No feature branch — doc-only changes follow the precedent of `970fa12` (README badges) landing directly on the active branch.

### Privacy hardening series — COMPLETE

All 8 plans done: 4, 5, 8a, 8b, 8c-pure-stub, 10, 1, 9. Plan 7 dropped at Plan 1 redesign. Plan 6 N/A. Plan 8c local-tracker shelved+preserved at `archive/plan8c-local-tracker-pre3`.


## 2026-05-14 — Investigation: missing "PC Game Settings" in Explorer-view More Menu for Steam games

### User report

In Explorer view (not Handheld), opening the game-detail page's More Menu for a Steam-linked game (Doomblade screenshot `Screenshot_20260514-195135.png` shows DOOMBLADE detail page with the bottom-sheet "More Menu"). Visible rows: Add to Desktop / Remove from Libr… / Edit Cover / PC Vibration… **PC Game Settings is missing.** Our injected PC Vibration row IS present.

### Trace

The More Menu Composable is `Lx57;->a(Lf37;Lpo7;Lv83;I)V` (already structurally anchored in `VibrationMenuRowPatch.kt` injection 1). Tracing the rows:

| Row | Smali line | Label source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PC Game Settings** (FIRST row in the original list) | 2421-2531 (gated `if-eqz v17, :cond_50` at line 2421) | `Lmil;->U:Lxrl;` → `Lggl(15)` → packed-switch `:pswitch_d` (line 4848) → const-string `"string:features_game_pc_settings"` (line 5134) → CVR-resolved to "PC Game Settings" |
| Other rows | 2526, 2648, 2738, 2821, 2939, 3021, 3109, 3203, 3294, 3503 (10 total `Lx9d;->add` calls in the method) | various Lwhl;/Lmil; label refs |

### Why PC Game Settings is hidden

`if-eqz v17, :cond_50` at line 2421 skips the entire row block when `v17 == 0`. `v17` is set at line 2055 (`move/from16 v17, v2`) from `v2`, which carries the AND-combined result of an 8-deep stacked check at lines 2200-2299 — each step does `invoke-interface ... Lxjk;->getValue()` (Compose-state reads), check-casts to Boolean/`Lj67;`/`Lg67;`, and `if-nez ... :cond_4b` short-circuit on mismatch.

Practical meaning: XiaoJi designed the More Menu's row visibility to filter out items that don't apply to the current launch method. PC Game Settings only makes sense for **plain Wine PC executables** — Steam-launched games go through Steam Lightweight Client (which has its own settings panel), so the raw DXVK/VKD3D/Box64/Wine prefix dialog would be a no-op for them. The 8 state reads are functionally "this game uses the direct PC pipeline" — at least one returns false for Steam-linked games, so v17 = 0, so the row is skipped.

This is **GameHub-native UX safety filtering**, not a BannerHub regression. Our Plan 1/4/5/8/10 patches don't touch this code path.

### Why our PC Vibration row IS visible

`VibrationMenuRowPatch.kt` injection 1 appends a Java-helper `appendVibrationRowTo(...)` call AFTER the LAST existing `Lx9d;->add` (per the patch comment, "after the last existing add() call"), so it sits OUTSIDE every gating block. It runs unconditionally for every game and every view. (PC Vibration actually works for Steam games via our `libevshim.so` shim, so showing it is appropriate.)

### Why this varies by view

Explorer view (game-detail page) uses `Lx57;->a()`. Handheld view (library tile popup) uses `Lpzc;->j0()` and `ted.smali::f()` per the menu-injection playbook. Different composables, different filter rules — so the same game can show PC Game Settings in one view but not the other.

### Decision

User direction: **remove all option gating in both menus** so every option shows for every game type and every view. UX safety filtering off. Implementing as a new bytecode patch — see next PROGRESS_LOG entry.

### Scope narrowed during planning

User narrowed the ask: "all I really care about is PC Game Settings, let the rest do whatever whenever". Only the PC Game Settings row in `Lx57;->a` (Explorer view) gets ungated. Other rows (PC Uninstall, Online Update, Instant Settings, Version Switch) keep their native gating. The Handheld-view `Lpzc;->j0` doesn't need patching since PC Game Settings already shows there.

## 2026-05-14 — `ShowPcGameSettingsRowPatch` shipped

### Patch

- File: `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/misc/ShowPcGameSettingsRowPatch.kt` (139 lines).
- Mechanism: single bytecode patch that finds the `Lmil;->U:Lxrl;` sget in `Lx57;->a()` (the PC Game Settings label load), scans backward up to 40 instructions for the nearest `if-eqz`/`if-nez`, and removes it. Control then falls through unconditionally into the row's `new-instance Liae` / ctor / `Lx9d;->add` sequence.
- Anchor fully structural — reuses `VibrationMenuRowPatch`'s menu-method predicate (`(Lf37;Lpo7;Lv83;I)V` + body constructs Liae rows + references Lwhl;->S). Then `sget Lmil;->U:Lxrl;` (single occurrence in the method) + backward scan for the gate. No hardcoded line numbers. Re-derivation recipe for future base bumps in the patch header.

### pre1 verification

- CI run [25895440581](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25895440581): 0 SEVERE, `"Show PC Game Settings row" succeeded` 9/9 variants.
- APK SHA-256: `1479a034e6235cd328462fdacf6b5123ff5b34ff741483863bd3a4ffbf44de41`.
- Decoded smali confirms: control now flows from `Lqs2;->y()` (line 2417) → `move-result-object v4` → `const v5, -0x3fa8c8e6` (line 2421, was line 2423 pre-patch). The `if-eqz v17, :cond_50` at the original line 2421 is gone.

### Merge

**Merge commit:** `656736e` (`--no-ff` of `feature/show-pc-game-settings` into `gamehub-604-build`).

`gamehub-604-build` HEAD now `656736e`. Artifact-only build triggered at run [25895723303](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25895723303) with version label `1.1.0-604-pcgs-merged-pre1`. No device-test gate before merge per user direction — patch is single-instruction-removal, low risk, CI + smali verified.


## 2026-05-14 — v1.2.0-604 STABLE shipped

### Release

- **Tag:** [`v1.2.0-604`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/releases/tag/v1.2.0-604)
- **CI run:** [25896000438](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25896000438) (workflow_dispatch with `stable=true`, `version=1.2.0-604`). 0 SEVERE; 45/45 key-patch successes (5 new patches × 9 variants). 9 APKs + `.rvp` + `.rve` attached.
- **Cert SHA-256:** `10895a311fe04f95f82e4da5c9a6c041ba9282bf211f1b578fe1cbeb894ce0ba` (unchanged from v1.1.0-604 — installs in place on top of v1.1.0-604).

### Headline changes vs `v1.1.0-604`

- **Privacy hardening stack** — 7 functional patches (Plans 4/5/8a/8b/8c/10/1) + 1 public doc (Plan 9 `PRIVACY.md`). Empirically verified: zero DNS queries to `statistic-gamehub-api.vgabc.com` during a 6.5-min full session.
- **PC Game Settings always visible in Explorer view** — single-instruction bytecode patch removes the if-eqz gate before the row.

### Device-test status at cut time

- ✅ Plan 1 (analytics-event stub) — DNS-recorder verified 2026-05-14
- ✅ Plan 10 (GMS Measurement) — `last_pause_time` frozen verified 2026-05-13
- ✅ ShowPcGameSettingsRowPatch — user-confirmed "PC Game Settings option works"
- ✅ Plans 4 / 5 / 8a / 8b / 8c / 9 — manifest/smali grep verified; standard CI verification sufficient

### Post-cut steps completed

- README.md: header version `v1.1.0-604` → `v1.2.0-604`, TOC link updated, "What's new" section rewritten for the privacy stack + PC Game Settings ungate.
- Release description: rewrote auto-generated body (stale "v1.1.0-604" content from previous template) with curated v1.2.0-604 notes via `gh release edit --notes-file`. 8 new patches added to the per-patch table with ⭐ markers.
- Privacy series memory + menu-gating memory + MEMORY.md index hook all in sync from earlier commits.
- Pre-release policy [[bannerhub-prerelease]] re-engages: from this point until the user says "stable" again, all builds default to artifact-only with `stable=false`.

`gamehub-604-build` HEAD at v1.2.0-604 cut: `195fbbd` (README docs commit prior to triggering the workflow). Tag points at the same commit per release.yml workflow behavior.


## 2026-05-15 — BannerHub V6 Lite Tier 6 spec (strip neutralized telemetry SDK trees) + reference-safety recon

### Context

User asked, in the spirit of how gamehub-lite was originally built (physical deletion of telemetry SDKs), whether more malware/spyware/telemetry can be removed from BannerHub V6 Lite. Finding: the **telemetry hunt is already complete** — the 8-plan privacy hardening series is shipped on `gamehub-604-build`, and `feature/lite-variant-tier1` branches off it, so Lite inherits every kill (Firebase Analytics, Mob Push init, Ad-ID perms, OTA, heartbeat, GMS Measurement, vgabc `/events`). The only telemetry **native lib** in 6.0.4 (`libpns`, 499 KB) is already physically deleted by Lite Tier 1. gamehub-lite's other deleted telemetry `.so`s (`libalicomphonenumberauthsdk_core`, `libumeng-spy`) do **not exist** in 6.0.4 (5.1.0 stack).

### The genuinely new lever

Our privacy series **neutralizes** telemetry SDKs (init disabled, manifest off) but **ships the classes in the dex**. gamehub-lite **deletes** them. A neutralized-but-present SDK can be re-activated by anyone who repacks the APK; a deleted one cannot. Tier 6 = convert neutralize→delete, **Lite-only**. Payoff is tamper-resistance + ethos, **not megabytes** (smali deflates to sub-MB on disk).

### Reference-safety recon (grep-verified in `gamehub_604_decompile`)

Cluster map:
- **Mob Push:** `smali_classes3/com/mob` (828) + `smali/cn/fly` (671 — Mob's renamed alias, easy to miss). ≈1,499 files.
- **Aliyun NumberAuth aggregator:** `smali_classes3/com/mobile/auth` (568) + `smali_classes3/com/nirvana` (94) + `smali/com/cmic` (15, China Mobile) + `smali_classes3/com/unicom` (4, China Unicom). ≈681 files.

Decisive finding: **the two clusters are not equally deletable.**

**Tier 6a — Mob Push (FEASIBLE, mirrors gamehub-lite).** 7 external referencers, classified:
- Plan-5 dormant no-op sites: `BaseAndroidApp.smali:29/247`, `nt5.smali:2863/3352/3360/3374/3380/3490` (Plan 5's `nt5.N(Context)` anchor — submitPolicyGrantResult / setClickNotificationToLaunchMainActivity / getRegistrationId / restartPush, deliberately left as dormant no-ops).
- Hard `.implements` glue (must rewrite, not orphan): `smali/li0.smali` `.implements Lcom/mob/pushsdk/MobPushReceiver;` and `smali_classes4/coh.smali` `.implements Lcom/mob/pushsdk/MobPushCallback;`. A class implementing a deleted interface fails verification at load → crash.
- Stray invoke-static (safe to remove line): `o1.smali` ×3 stopPush, `at0.smali:14688` setAlias, `hi5.smali:2753` stopPush, `coh.smali:165` addTags.
- Patch: `StripMobPushPatch.kt` (`use=false`). Layer A bytecode (excise 7 referencers' Mob refs + rewrite `li0`/`coh` to drop `.implements` + stub interface methods, structural anchors). Layer B optional manifest cleanup (delete dangling disabled `com.mob.*`/`cn.fly.*` components). Layer C resourcePatch dep deletes `smali_classes3/com/mob/**` + `smali/cn/fly/**`. Verify per privacy-series recipe + no `NoClassDefFoundError`/`VerifyError`.

**Tier 6b — Aliyun NumberAuth + operator SDKs (GATED — defer).** Unlike Mob, this cluster is **NOT dead code.** 17 external referencers are *live* carrier one-tap login UI: `fxo` (4068 ln, implements `TokenResultListener`), `myo` (5360 ln, implements `TokenResultListener`), `y2o` (implements `TokenResultListener`), `wsm` (active `getInstance`/`getReporter`/`setAuthSDKInfo`), `wd`/`vd`/`xd`/`zd`/`jxe`/`b1`/`p1` (manipulate `PhoneNumberAuthHelper`/`TokenRet`). Tier 1's `DisableNumberAuthPatch` stubbed only the *native* `k7e.a()` + deleted `libpns`; the Java login path is still live. Deleting these trees crashes login unless first proven unreachable under `BypassLogin` AND the ~17 glue classes' `.implements TokenResultListener` rewritten. **Deferred** because Tier 6b is login-path surgery and Lite Tiers 1–4 are still in beta device-testing for exactly the Steam/Epic login path — wrong sequencing to stack it now.

### Recommended sequencing

Ship **Tier 6a alone** as the next Lite increment (clean, low-risk, full gamehub-lite-style Mob deletion, zero feature cost). Keep **Tier 6b shelved** with this recon as the durable anchor until: (1) Lite beta clears the Steam/Epic launch gate, (2) a recon proves BypassLogin makes the `PhoneNumberAuthHelper` path unreachable, (3) the ~17 glue classes are rewritten. Full spec recorded in memory `bannerhub-revanced-lite-variant` (tier table rows 6a/6b + "Tier 6 spec" section). **Not yet implemented — awaiting user go-ahead on Tier 6a / beta merge gate.**


## 2026-05-15 — Lite branch state review + user beta-testing pass begins

### State verified against live repo (not just memory)

`feature/lite-variant-tier1` head = `895f289` (Tier 4 CI-verified, "corrected size to -34.52 MB"). **Not merged** into `gamehub-604-build` (confirmed via `git branch --merged`). Tiers 1(+2)/3/4 all CI-green; Tiers 1+3 device-confirmed; Tier 4 image-rendering device-confirmed (cover art/avatars fine, keeper). Final size locked at **−34.52 MB vs Normal** (114.54 → 78.35 MB, −31.6%). Tier 5 permanently rejected by user (Lite keeps full Steam+Epic). No newer commits beyond what memory recorded — repo and `bannerhub-revanced-lite-variant` memory are in sync.

### What changed this session

User is now **starting the beta device-testing pass** on Beta1 (`banner.hub.lite`, 78.4 MB, hand-attached to v1.2.0-604 stable release). The single open merge-gate is the **Steam/Epic login + game-launch path under Tiers 1/3/4**. Status moves from "awaiting user device test" → **"user testing in progress"**. Merge to `gamehub-604-build` and Tier 6a kickoff both remain blocked on the user's verdict from this pass. No code changes — status/tracking update only.

### Also recorded this session (separate workstream)

New PLANNED patch memory `bannerhub-revanced-firmware-update-gate`: neutralize the launch-time forced-imagefs-update gate (verified at `c4o.smali:895‑931` → `Lf4o;->a(IMAGE_FS)` vs MMKV `firmware_ver`) while leaving the manual components-menu update (`getAllComponentList`→`Lj7o;`) intact. Build trigger = next firmware release pushed to BannerHub-API, then device-test launch-on-old-firmware + manual-update-still-works. Not started.


## 2026-05-16 — Lite beta-testing pass: DiRT 3 launch-fail root-caused = Box64-path resolution bug (game-launch merge-gate blocker)

### Context
First concrete failure from the 2026-05-15 Lite beta device-testing pass (`banner.hub.lite`, the single open merge-gate = Steam/Epic login + **game-launch** path). User reported DiRT 3 fails to launch / immediately falls back to the game library. Initial hypothesis (user's): the BannerHub 3.7.x evshim/Box64 vibration regression. **Disproven.**

### Method
Side-by-side log capture of the same game (DiRT 3, gameId 131962, SD exe `/storage/6B68-39AB/Winlator/Games/DiRT 3 Complete Edition/.../dirt3_game.exe`, steamAppId 321040) on Lite `banner.hub.lite` vs **vanilla GameHub 6.0.4** (`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact` pkg) via logcat-bridge (`getlog` ring-buffer pull + `--ls`/`--cat` root verbs; app does not persist box64/wine stderr and `pcLaunchLog` is params-only — known gotcha).

### Findings
- **Lite `:wine` (pid 12020): 15:38:21→15:38:33 (~12 s), emitted ZERO `winemu`/`wine`/`box64`/`ProcessHelper`/`services.exe`/`plugplay` tags.** Dies *before* Wine init. No tombstone / linker / `evshim:` line (silent). → back to library.
- **Vanilla `:wine` (pid 12473): ~61 s**, full boot — dbus → `winemu` → `gamepad` → SteamKit → `services.exe`/`plugplay` → loads `kernel32/kernelbase/ntdll` from `wine_proton10.0-x64-1/x86_64/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/`.
- **Decisive diff = `launchLog131962.txt` param dumps:**
  - Lite: `box64转译器路径 = ` **(EMPTY)** ; `cpuTranslatorConfig id=local_Performance, box64Path=""`
  - Vanilla: `box64转译器路径 = .../components/Box64-0.4.1-2/box64` ; `cpuTranslatorConfig id=local_Extreme, box64Path=""`
- DiRT 3 is x86_64 (`isArm64X=false`) → with no Box64 translator path the wine proc dies pre-init. Both: Proton 10 x64, DirectLaunch, same exe.
- **Box64 IS installed on Lite** — `usr/home/components/{Box64-0.4.1-2,Box64-0.4.1-fix,Box64-0.4.3,Box64-Hybrid-Bionic}` + `usr/bin/box64`. Wine DLL tree + rootfs **byte-identical to vanilla (757 files each)**. So NOT a missing/partial install.

### Root cause
**Per-game Box64-component RESOLUTION bug specific to the ReVanced Lite build.** The per-game CPU profile `id=local_Performance` (box64Path empty) is not mapped to an installed Box64 directory at launch, so the launcher passes an empty `box64转译器路径`. Vanilla's `id=local_Extreme` resolves correctly. Definitively NOT the evshim/vibration regression (box64 never spawns; zero `evshim:` tags) and NOT GFWL (dies long before game code).

### Status / next
- Confirm + workaround handed to user: explicitly select **Box64-0.4.1-2** in DiRT 3's per-game CPU translator (instead of the "Performance" preset) and relaunch → expected to boot Wine.
- Real fix lives in the Lite line's box64-path resolver / default-profile (`local_Performance`) mapping — likely a Lite-variant strip. Code dig **not yet started** (awaiting user go-ahead). This is a **game-launch merge-gate blocker** for the Lite → `gamehub-604-build` merge.
- Memory updated: `bannerhub-evshim-breaks-x86-64-box64-launches-v3-7-0-regression` (root-cause paragraph) + `bannerhub-revanced-lite-variant` (Box64-resolution-bug pointer). No code changes this session.

### UPDATE same session — root cause CONFIRMED, and it is NOT a Lite-build bug

Deeper diagnosis (user reported "custom box64 components aren't working in v6", + asked to audit app component files):
- On-device `usr/home/components/` audit: **empty (0-file) dirs** = `Box64-0.4.3`, `Box64-0.4.1-fix`, `Box64-Hybrid-Bionic`, `Fex_20260428`, `FEXCore-2603`, `FEXCore-2605`, `vkd3d-proton-3.0.1`. Working = `Box64-0.4.1-2`, `Fex-20251025`, `Fex_20260509`, `dxvk-2.3.1-async`, `vkd3d-2.12`, drivers, mono, etc.
- `curl`+`tar -tf` of release assets: working `Box64-0.4.1-2.tzst` = flat `./box64`; the 3 custom Box64 `.tzst` = `./` + `profile.json` + `box64` (Winlator `.wcp` internal layout). v6 type=1 extractor expects flat bare binary → `.wcp`-layout archive yields an empty component dir → x86_64 `:wine` dies pre-Wine-init.
- **Conclusion: this is a BannerHub-API release-asset packaging defect, NOT a Lite-build code bug, NOT the box64-path resolver, NOT evshim/vibration, NOT GFWL.** The earlier "Lite resolver / `local_Performance` mapping" hypothesis is **withdrawn** — `local_Performance` resolves fine; the binary is just absent because the archive never unpacks. The Lite line needs **no code change** for this; the fix is entirely in bannerhub-api (repackage flat + bump md5/size/url lockstep + re-upload + `npm run build`).
- Records: bannerhub-api `PROGRESS_LOG.md` `## 2026-05-16` full fix recipe; memory `bannerhub-api-box64-tzst-flat-layout` (new durable rule), `bannerhub-revanced-lite-variant` blocker entry rewritten to confirmed cause, MEMORY.md index. Merge-gate for x86_64 titles stays blocked until bannerhub-api assets are repackaged. Interim user workaround: select `Box64-0.4.1-2`.

### FIX LANDED (API side) — same session

bannerhub-api commit `983fd47` (pushed main+master): scope corrected 7→**5** on recursive re-audit (`vkd3d-proton-3.0.1` was a first-audit false-positive — extracts fine into `system32/`+`syswow64/`; `Fex_20260428` archive already correct, empty on-device for an unrelated reason — both left untouched). 5 repackaged flat + re-uploaded + `custom_components.json` md5/size/url + `version_code` 1→2 + `npm run build`. Prevention tooling shipped same commit (`scripts/wcp2tzst.sh`, `scripts/check_component_layout.sh`, ADDING_NEW_COMPONENTS.md). **Lite line unchanged (correctly — zero code needed).** Merge-gate now waits only on: GitHub Pages rebuild (~1-2 min + CDN) → user device re-test (`banner.hub.lite`, pick e.g. Box64-0.4.3 for DiRT 3, confirm Wine boots) → if green, the x86_64-launch blocker is cleared.

**VERIFIED ON DEVICE 2026-05-16:** post-propagation, `Box64-0.4.3`/`Box64-Hybrid-Bionic` extract `box64` (files=1, were 0); box64 exec'd from component dir; **Wine fully boots** (`esync up and running`, ProcessHelper Wine-debug, ntoskrnl/init_peb — native tree 100% absent pre-fix). **Packaging blocker for x86_64 game launch on Lite = CLEARED on the API side; Lite line needs no change.** Separate residual (does NOT re-block the gate): DiRT 3 is 32-bit, `onStopGame`s ~8 s with `err:wow:load_64bit_module c000007b` under x64-Proton experimental wow64 — a 32-bit-game/container/wow64 compat matter tracked apart (user retesting with regular Box64-0.4.3).

### 2026-05-16 — DiRT 3 32-bit/WoW64: wrong hypothesis withdrawn, root cause refined

Box64-0.4.3 AND Box64-0.4.1-fix retested → identical `c000007b`/experimental-wow64 stop (all 3 fixed Box64 builds verified extracting/running; packaging 100% confirmed). I had concluded "32-bit needs arm64x/FEX; box64+x64 is a dead end" — **user challenged it** (DiRT 3 runs on BannerHub 3.7.3 PuBG/`com.tencent.ig` on Proton-10-x64+Box64). Verified → **conclusion was wrong, withdrawn** (instance of always-verify-never-assume). On-device: `wine_proton10.0-x64-1`, its `x86_64/lib/wine/{i386-windows,x86_64-unix,x86_64-windows}` tree, and `box64` (19,380,160 B) are **byte-identical** in `com.tencent.ig` (3.7.3) vs `banner.hub.lite` (v6); 3.7.3 ran DiRT 3 cleanly ~26 min on that exact stack (x86_64 winebus.so mapped → 64-bit WoW64 side came up). So box64+new-WoW64 *can* run 32-bit DiRT 3. **Refined root cause:** same Wine+box64 → differentiator is **v6's app-level launch orchestration** (per-game container/prefix 131962 mis-set-up or DLL-mismatch / residue; empty launch ENV vs Winlator-Cmod's `BOX64_*`/`WINEDLLOVERRIDES`/WoW64 exports; v6 `run.exe` shim forcing experimental wow64). NOT packaging, NOT FEX-vs-box64, NOT Lite code. Decisive next step: capture a working 3.7.3 (`com.tencent.ig`) DiRT 3 launch and diff vs v6 (container/prefix/env/wow64-mode). Full detail in memory `bannerhub-revanced-lite-variant` CORRECTION block.

**RESOLVED same session — differentiator pinned.** Captured working 3.7.3 DiRT 3 (`com.tencent.ig` pid 22133): **30–40 fps, game running.** Byte-identical inputs vs v6: same `wine_proton10.0-x64-1`, `isArm64X=false`, `Box64(local_Extreme)`, same `run.exe_v16045985`, both prefixes system32+syswow64. **Only difference:** `experimental wow64 mode` = **0 occurrences** in the 3.7.3 capture (no `load_64bit_module`/`c000007b`); v6 prints it every launch → dies. ⇒ GameHub 6.0.4 (v6) forces Wine **experimental NEW WoW64**; Winlator-Cmod (3.7.3) runs the SAME Proton in **classic WoW64** → identical box64 stack, opposite result. Structural tell: v6 container 131962 = layered base+delta prefix (`.base`,`*.reg.base` — GH6.0 virtual-container overlay); 3.7.3 = flat prefix. **Root cause = upstream GameHub-6.0.4 launcher forcing experimental WoW64, which fails the 64-bit thunk under box64 for 32-bit titles.** NOT box64/Proton/config/packaging/FEX/Lite-code. Fix is app/container-side only (stop forcing experimental WoW64 / use classic-WoW64 container template). Open follow-up: locate the exact env/prefix-bootstrap knob in GH6.0.4 winemu selecting new-vs-classic WoW64. Full detail: memory `bannerhub-revanced-lite-variant` RESOLVED block.

**Follow-up investigation — narrowed to launcher ENV; exact knob still open.** Proved EVERY binary/config identical v6↔3.7.x: Proton-10-x64 wine (`ntdll.so`/`wow64*.dll`/i386 `ntdll.dll` sizes all match), box64 (19,380,160 B), **`run.exe_v16045985` byte-identical md5 `834f2c84…`, 32-bit PE (0x14c)**, both prefixes `#arch=win64`+syswow64, identical per-game config. "experimental wow64 mode" is Wine's own `err:environ:init_peb` string (in NO app code); both apps must use new-WoW64 (win64 prefix, no i386-unix) — real diff = v6 `load_64bit_module` **fails `c000007b`** vs 3.7.x **succeeds**. ⇒ sole remaining variable = the **box64+wine runtime env/cmdline** built by the two different launcher frontends (v6 GH-6.0.4 `com.xiaoji.egggame` winemu vs 3.7.x Winlator-Cmod `com/winemu`); `c000007b` under box64 = box64 can't resolve a 64-bit ELF dep → `BOX64_LD_LIBRARY_PATH`/`BOX64_PATH`/`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`/`BOX64_EMULATED_LIBS`/wine-loader-path class of env. No env-wrapper file written to tmp/container (in-process env). Exact knob needs (a) live `/proc/<wine-pid>/environ`+`cmdline` diff (bridge may block /proc; ~8 s window) or (b) read env-builder in `gamehub_604_jadx` winemu vs `bannerhub-370-pubg-decoded/.../com/winemu/core/{Wine,WineHelper$Companion,DependencyManager}`. Awaiting user pick of (a)/(b).

### Decompile dig (option b) — partial; lead raised & DISPROVEN, pivot to (a)

3.7.x env literals owned by `com/winemu/core/controller/EnvironmentController` + `com/winemu/core/trans_layer/Box64Config` + ReVanced injection `app/revanced/extension/gamehub/BhWineLaunchHelper` (src `~/bannerhub/extension/BhWineLaunchHelper.java`; patches `~/bannerhub/patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/{BhExeLaunchListener,BhInitLaunchRunnable,BhTaskManagerFragment}.smali`). v6/`bannerhub-revanced` confirmed has **no** BhWineLaunchHelper/WINELOADER/wow64 patch — looked like the answer. **Disproven by the .java:** BhWineLaunchHelper = in-session **“Launch tab”** utility (BhTaskManagerFragment) that *reads* WINELOADER/WINEPREFIX/environ from an already-running wine proc and launches extra exes into a live session — NOT the primary game-launch / WoW64 bootstrap. Not the differentiator (always-verify: the obvious-looking helper was a red herring). Primary-launch env build is GameHub winemu core (`EnvironmentController`/`Box64Config` vs obfuscated GH-6.0.4 KMP) — RE of obfuscated KMP for the exact var is error-prone. **Net positive: BhWineLaunchHelper.java itself reads `/proc/<pid>/environ`+`/comm` → /proc/environ IS readable on this device → option (a) is feasible and now the higher-confidence path.** Recommending pivot to (a): capture & diff `/proc/<wine-pid>/{environ,cmdline}` of a working 3.7.x vs failing v6 DiRT 3 launch. Memory `bannerhub-revanced-lite-variant` updated.


### Static/bridge avenues exhausted — honest dead-end; pivot to live --ps

(a) `/proc` env diff BLOCKED: `getlog --ps` works but `getlog --cat /proc/<pid>/{environ,cmdline}` → bridge allowlist rejects /proc. BhWineLaunchHelper reads /proc only as the app's own uid (not via root bridge). (b) Static env-literal-set diff v6↔3.7.x launchers ≈ identical; sole delta `WINELOADER` is present **only in BhWineLaunchHelper.smali** (the already-ruled-out in-session Launch-tab reader), NOT in the `com/winemu/core/*` primary launcher → 2nd disproven lead, both trace back to the same red-herring helper. Conclusion: env-var NAME sets identical; differentiator is dynamic env VALUES / exec argv / process structure — not extractable via static literals or the /proc-blocked bridge; obfuscated GH-6.0.4 KMP control-flow RE proven error-prone twice. Only remaining feasible probe: live `getlog --ps` during both launches (box64/wine process tree + NAME/args + PPID chain) for working 3.7.x vs failing v6 — ground-truth for invoked-loader/argv difference, though exact env-value may stay out of reach without root shell/strace (unavailable). Honest scope set with user. Detail: memory `bannerhub-revanced-lite-variant`.


### (A)-vs-(B) RESOLVED — it's (B): BannerHub/ReVanced-introduced, NOT upstream

Decisive test: **stock GameHub 6.0.4** (`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`, unmodified; box64 neutralized = 0.4.3-hybrid dropped in as `Box64-0.4.1-2`; identical settings isArm64X=false / Box64-Extreme / Proton-10-x64) ran DiRT 3 (131962): `experimental wow64`/`load_64bit_module`/`c000007b` = **0 occurrences**, `isBooted=true`, **game rendered** (FPS 0→15.2→8.5 over ~5 s), `Idle→HandleByDestroy normalExit=true` clean exit (user-closed ~19 s). Corroborated by earlier cap2 stock run (isBooted=true, 44 s, normalExit). ⇒ stock 6.0.4 runs DiRT 3 on the EXACT stack that makes `banner.hub.lite` die at c000007b. **Conclusion: the WoW64/c000007b failure is introduced by the `bannerhub-revanced` (GameHub-6.0.4 ReVanced) patch layer — NOT a stock-GameHub-6.0.4 upstream defect, NOT Box64/packaging/Proton.** Not an upstream bug to report (also: closed-source XiaoJi, reporter is an auth-bypassing fork — impractical regardless). Earlier offhand "vanilla also died" was imprecise — stock was a normal boot+exit, never the crash. **Fix scope now = find which bannerhub-revanced patch breaks the winemu launch/container/env.** Working refs (boot DiRT 3 Wine, no c000007b): stock GH-6.0.4 (`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`) + BannerHub-3.7.x (`com.tencent.ig`); sole failing build = `banner.hub.lite`. Next: diff stock-6.0.4 vs banner.hub.lite launch path; suspects = patches touching winemu launch / layered container provisioning / env / stripped class/component (privacy-hardening, login-bypass, menu-injection, Lite strips). Full detail: memory `bannerhub-revanced-lite-variant`.


### Correction — stock 6.0.4 also bounces; TWO distinct problems

User observed stock `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact` DiRT 3 also "launched, started, immediately exited to library." Re-read pid 6118: Wine booted → engine Running+GameLoadComplete → **DXVK presented (960x540, FPS~15)** → 8× WindowRealizedCallback + onWindowStop/StartPresent churn → `winemu Client disconnected` (guest exe self-exited) → Idle/normalExit→onStopGame→library (~14 s). Prior "stock runs it fine" was OVERSTATED — stock renders briefly then DiRT 3 self-exits; not playable. **Two separate problems:** (1) `c000007b` WoW64 pre-Wine death = ONLY `banner.hub.lite`, BannerHub-V6/ReVanced-introduced (verdict (B) stands; not upstream); (2) DiRT 3 self-exits after ~10 s render = present in **stock GH-6.0.4 too** = a GH-6.0.x-generation issue, absent only on BannerHub-3.7.x/GH-5.x (sustained 30-40 fps). Fixing #1 only brings banner.hub.lite to parity with stock (launch→render→exit), NOT playable; #2 is a separate GH-6.0.x-vs-5.x regression (suspect DiRT 3 GFWL/xlive or 6.0 engine/window handling — no explicit GFWL line captured). Only sustained-playable ref = BannerHub-3.7.x. Detail: memory `bannerhub-revanced-lite-variant`.


### PROBLEM 1 CULPRIT FOUND — VibrationPatch LD_PRELOAD libevshim (the v3.7.0 regression, unported)

Patch-culprit diff: stock GH-6.0.4 (`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`) vs `banner.hub.lite` are byte-identical (Proton/wine .so sizes, `run.exe` md5 `834f2c84c35396e35619db9abb24a217`, embedded files, container prefix overlay incl. `#arch=win64`+`.reg.base`, box64) ⇒ culprit = a code patch, not runtime/API/container/packaging. **Culprit: `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/vibration/VibrationPatch.kt` Hook 4 (~line 155) "ENV_BUILDER.a(...)V — prepend libevshim.so to LD_PRELOAD"** — injects 13 smali insns into GameHub-6.0.4's Wine env-builder (`dg5`) to prepend `<nativeLibraryDir>/libevshim.so` to `LD_PRELOAD` on every launch; `VibrationLibPatch.kt` ships `lib/arm64-v8a/libevshim.so`. This IS the v3.7.0 evshim/box64 regression (memory `bannerhub-evshim-breaks-x86-64-box64-launches-v3-7-0-regression`): libevshim LD_PRELOAD destabilizes box64/WoW64 → here manifests as `experimental wow64`→`err:wow:load_64bit_module c000007b` pre-Wine. Stock has no VibrationPatch ⇒ no preload ⇒ Wine boots + DXVK renders (Problem 1 absent). **The preload-free winebus on-disk fix shipped in BannerHub 3.7.4 (merge `9d9a62821`, ref `reference_gamehub_vibration_fix_preloadfree`) was never ported to bannerhub-revanced** — gamehub-604-build VibrationPatch still uses old LD_PRELOAD-libevshim. Per-game vibration toggle does NOT disable it. Closes user's turn-1 question: banner.hub.lite DiRT3 failure = the same vibration/evshim issue, masked earlier by the (now-fixed) Box64 packaging bug. **FIX:** branch off gamehub-604-build (per branch-per-patch rule); rip out Hook-4 LD_PRELOAD + libevshim ship; reimplement preload-free (static winebus.so SDL-duration disk patch, aarch64+x86_64, à la TideGear PR#91 / BannerHub 3.7.4) — see memory `project_bannerhub_revanced_vibration`. Problem 2 (stock GH-6.0.x DiRT3 self-exits after ~10 s render) separate/secondary, not this. Detail: memory `bannerhub-revanced-lite-variant`.


### Recon: TideGear/GameHub-Vibration-Fix adoption (investigate-only)

User relayed explicit dev permission to use https://github.com/TideGear/GameHub-Vibration-Fix for our 6.0.4. Cloned + inspected. Repo = canonical **preload-free** fix, README explicitly **targets stock 6.0.4** (our base). Artifacts: `extension/BhVibrationController.java` (in-process winebus.so disk-patcher: `ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce(Context)` + `patchWinebusDurationFile`, AtomicBoolean gate, aarch64 `ldur w3,[x29,#-0x14]`→`mov w3,#-1` / x86_64 11-byte clang window → `or ecx,-1`, `winebus_dump_x86_64.so` miss-fallback), `BhVibrationSettingsActivity.java`, `scripts/apply_vibration_patches.py` (4 smali hooks, ProGuard `ab8`=Physical/`bg5`=envbuilder/`ps2.I0`=join). **1:1 structural match with our `VibrationPatch.kt`** (same 4 hooks, same pkg `Lcom/xj/winemu/vibration/BhVibrationController;`, same anchors `Lab8;`/`Lbg5;`/`Lps2;`). Hooks 1-3 identical; **only Hook 4 differs** — ours prepends libevshim.so to LD_PRELOAD (the bug), TideGear calls `ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce(ctx)` at the same bg5 env-builder site (the fix, no LD_PRELOAD). **→ Answer to user's "1 patch not 2": YES, it's a REWORK of the existing single VibrationPatch, not a second fixer.** Plan (NOT yet done): branch off gamehub-604-build → in VibrationPatch.kt swap Hook-4 libevshim/LD_PRELOAD block for the `ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce` invoke → delete VibrationLibPatch.kt (stop shipping libevshim.so) → replace extension Bh*.java with TideGear's (attribution kept). Precedent = BannerHub 3.7.4 did identical for Winlator line (PR #91). Caveats: fixes Problem 1 only (→ stock-6.0.4 parity; unblocks all x86_64/32-bit titles w/o Problem 2); Problem 2 (DiRT3 self-exit, in stock too, not preload-caused) separate; ignore repo test keys + login-bypass script; verify base-APK R8 map at impl. Detail: memory `tidegear-gamehub-vibration-fix-preload-free-winebus-patch-reference`.


### IMPLEMENTED — preload-free vibration rework (branch `fix/vibration-preload-free`)

Branched off `gamehub-604-build` @ `9fa3c53`. Single coherent rework (NOT a 2nd patch):
- **`extensions/.../vibration/BhVibrationController.java`**: ported TideGear's preload-free disk-patcher verbatim (constants block + `ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce`/`ensureWinebusDurationPatch`/`scanWinebusFiles`/`patchWinebusDurationFile`/`patchAarch64Sites`/`patchX86_64Sites`/`collectWildcardHits`/`dumpForOfflineAnalysis`/`readElfMachine`/`startsWith`/`collectHits`/`indexOf`) + 2 imports (`java.io.IOException`,`java.io.RandomAccessFile`). Verified zero name collisions; brace balance 201/201; existing onRumble/dispatchToController/onStop + settings/menu API untouched (BhMenuRowClick / BhVibrationSettingsActivity unchanged → menu patches unaffected). Attribution comment added.
- **`VibrationPatch.kt`**: Hook 4 swapped from libevshim `LD_PRELOAD` `addInstructionsWithLabels` block → 2-instruction `addInstructions` (`iget-object v13, v0, ENV_BUILDER->a:Landroid/content/Context;` + `invoke-static {v13}, BhVibrationController->ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce(Landroid/content/Context;)V`) at the same join-setup anchor (no labels/branch; v13 consumed before join setup re-inits it). Dropped `vibrationLibPatch` from `dependsOn`; removed now-unused imports (`ExternalLabel`/`getInstruction`/`addInstructionsWithLabels`); rewrote description. Hooks 1–3 unchanged.
- **Deleted**: `VibrationLibPatch.kt` (stops shipping `libevshim.so`), `native/evshim/{CMakeLists.txt,evshim.c}` (dead).
- **`release.yml`**: removed the "Build libevshim.so" NDK step; rewrote 2 release-notes blocks to describe preload-free.
- **`README.md`**: rewrote the vibration + (removed) native-shim sections to preload-free.
Only stale residue: a one-line *comment* in `icon/ChangeAppIconPatch.kt:97` ("same trick as VibrationLibPatch") — harmless, left as-is.
Net: ONE working `PC-accurate vibration` patch, preload-free, rumble retained, no libevshim/LD_PRELOAD/extra-mapping. Fixes Problem 1 (c000007b launch death) for all x86_64/32-bit titles; brings banner.hub.lite to stock-6.0.4 parity. Problem 2 (DiRT3 self-exit, stock-6.0.x too) separate/unaffected. NOT locally built (per CI-only rule) — push branch → CI build is the validator. Refs: memory `tidegear-gamehub-vibration-fix-preload-free-winebus-patch-reference`, `bannerhub-revanced-lite-variant`.

**CI branch-compile GREEN** — run [25974552956](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25974552956) `Build pull request` on `fix/vibration-preload-free` = success. Confirms the ported TideGear disk-patcher Java + reworked VibrationPatch.kt compile, and that deleting VibrationLibPatch/native/evshim + the release.yml edits didn't break the patch bundle. NEXT (user-driven): trigger a Release build off this branch for a testable `banner.hub.lite` APK → device-test DiRT 3 + other x86_64/32-bit titles (expect Problem 1 cleared, rumble retained). Not yet merged to gamehub-604-build (per branch-per-patch + await device confirmation).

**Release build GREEN (artifact-only)** — run [25974755558](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25974755558), `version=1.1.0-604-vibpf-pre1`, all 9 variants patched success, `Create GitHub Release` skipped (pre-release policy). Confirms edited `release.yml` builds end-to-end without the libevshim NDK step and the preload-free VibrationPatch + ported extension apply cleanly to the real GH-6.0.4 base across every variant. APK pulled to device: `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-vibpf-pre1-Normal-GHL.apk` (114,551,047 B; Normal-GHL variant — branch is off gamehub-604-build so NO Lite size-strips, but FULL preload-free vibration fix). Awaiting user device test: DiRT 3 + other x86_64/32-bit titles boot (no c000007b) + rumble incl. sustained hold; then merge `fix/vibration-preload-free`→`gamehub-604-build`.


## 2026-05-16 — SESSION STATE SUMMARY (consolidated checkpoint)

Long investigation chain, resolved end-to-end. For a future session, the state in one place:

**Reported symptom:** DiRT 3 (and x86_64/32-bit titles) fail to launch on `banner.hub.lite` (BannerHub V6 Lite), bounce to library.

**Resolution chain (all root-caused, not guessed):**
1. **BannerHub-API packaging bug (FIXED, shipped):** custom Box64/FEX `.tzst` were repackaged from `.wcp` with `./`+`profile.json` layout → extracted EMPTY on v6. Repacked flat (3 Box64 + 2 FEXCore), re-uploaded, catalog bumped, `npm run build`; converter+validator+docs added. Commit `983fd47` on `bannerhub-api` main+master. Device-verified: components now extract, Wine boots.
2. **Residual `c000007b` root cause (root-caused):** with box64 fixed, DiRT 3 still died `experimental wow64`→`err:wow:load_64bit_module c000007b` pre-Wine. Proved NOT box64/Proton/config/packaging/FEX, NOT upstream — **stock GH-6.0.4 (`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`, unmodified) launches DiRT 3 fine** on the byte-identical stack. Patch-culprit diff → **`VibrationPatch.kt` Hook 4 (libevshim.so → LD_PRELOAD)** = the v3.7.0 evshim regression, unported to the ReVanced line.
3. **Preload-free rework (IMPLEMENTED, CI+Release green, awaiting device test):** branch `fix/vibration-preload-free` off `gamehub-604-build`@`9fa3c53`. Ported TideGear's on-disk winebus duration patcher into `BhVibrationController.java`; Hook 4 → `ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce(ctx)`; deleted `VibrationLibPatch.kt`+`native/evshim/`+CI libevshim step; README/release-notes refreshed. ONE coherent patch, rumble retained, settings/menu API untouched. Commits `5fe95a8`/`2d2b5a0`/`72630f5`. CI branch-compile `25974552956` ✅; Release `25974755558` ✅ (artifact-only, 9 variants). Test APK: `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-vibpf-pre1-Normal-GHL.apk`.

**NEXT:** device-test that APK → DiRT 3 + another x86_64/32-bit title boot (no c000007b) + controller rumble incl. sustained hold. If green → merge `fix/vibration-preload-free`→`gamehub-604-build` (branch-per-patch). 

**KNOWN SEPARATE — Problem 2 (NOT addressed, NOT this fix):** DiRT 3 self-exits ~10 s after it renders — reproduces on **stock GameHub 6.0.4 too** (a GH-6.0.x-generation issue; only the 5.x-lineage BannerHub 3.7.x sustains DiRT 3). The preload-free fix brings `banner.hub.lite` to stock-6.0.4 parity (launch+render), not full DiRT 3 playability. Pursue separately if needed (suspect GFWL/xlive or 6.0 engine/window handling).

Memory updated: `bannerhub-revanced-vibration-port-feature-vibration-branch` (CURRENT STATE block prepended), `tidegear-...-preload-free...` (IMPLEMENTED), `bannerhub-revanced-lite-variant`, MEMORY.md index.


## 2026-05-16 — MERGED to gamehub-604-build

Device test PASSED (user-confirmed: DiRT 3 boots, no c000007b; rumble incl. sustained hold works). `fix/vibration-preload-free` (`dc30275`) merged into `gamehub-604-build` via **`--no-ff` merge commit `72bb018`** (identity The412Banner, no Claude trailer), pushed `9fa3c53..72bb018`. Brought: preload-free `VibrationPatch` Hook 4 + ported winebus disk-patcher in `BhVibrationController.java`; deletions of `VibrationLibPatch.kt`, `native/evshim/{evshim.c,CMakeLists.txt}`, CI libevshim step; README/release-notes refreshed. Clean merge (604-build was ancestor of the fix branch; no conflicts). `fix/vibration-preload-free` retained on origin as history. Post-merge branch-compile CI triggered for sanity.

**FOLLOW-UP REQUIRED (user-flagged):** `feature/lite-variant-tier1` was branched off gamehub-604-build BEFORE this rework → still carries the old libevshim LD_PRELOAD VibrationPatch and will hit the same c000007b. Must bring `72bb018` into the Lite branch (merge/rebase gamehub-604-build → feature/lite-variant-tier1) and rebuild the Lite variant before any new `banner.hub.lite` Lite build. Until then Lite builds still have the broken vibration patch.


## 2026-05-16 — v1.3.0-604 STABLE shipped (9 full APKs + GitHub Release)

Dispatched `release.yml` on `gamehub-604-build` with `version=1.3.0-604` `stable=true` → run [25977976554](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25977976554) ✅ → 9 full variant APKs + GitHub Release `BannerHub v6 1.3.0-604` (tag `v1.3.0-604`). Built off `ed355d3` (preload-free vibration in place; matrix unchanged — canonical 9 full variants incl. `Normal-GHL`).

**Dual-build flow (first use):** the separate, never-merged `feature/lite-variant-tier1` branch (@`13ac017`) was dispatched in parallel with `version=1.3.0-604` `stable=false` → run [25977995330](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/25977995330) ✅ → 9 Lite APKs as Actions artifacts (its `release` job auto-skipped by the `stable==true` gate). The 9 Lite APKs (≈78.3 MB each) were manually attached to the v1.3.0-604 release via `gh run download … -p 'apk-*-Lite'` + `gh release upload`. **Release now carries 21 assets** = 9 full + 9 Lite + 3 `.rvp`.

Release-description edit (user request): the dedicated `### ✨ What's new in 1.1.0-604` section was removed from the notes (the workflow's notes template still carried it); 0 occurrences remain. Inline `⭐ *new in 1.1.0-604*` patch-table provenance markers left as-is (out of scope).

**Resolves the prior FOLLOW-UP:** the Lite branch already carries the preload-free vibration (`72bb018` merged in via `1b567ae`); these Lite APKs are libevshim-free.

**Stable-release-checklist note (NOT yet done — awaiting user direction):** README on this branch still shows "Latest stable: v1.2.0-604" + a "What's new in v1.2.0-604" section + ToC entry; release notes are still the stale 1.1.0/1.2.0 template (only the 1.1.0 section was pulled per request). README bump + a real 1.3.0-604 "What's new" + a release-notes rewrite were not requested and were not done unilaterally.


## 2026-05-16 — v1.3.0-604 stable-release-checklist completed

Followed up the prior entry's flagged item (user approved). Release notes on the v1.3.0-604 GitHub Release rewritten via `gh release edit --notes-file`: added a real **✨ What's new in 1.3.0-604** section (preload-free vibration / x86_64 c000007b fix + 9 Lite APKs), added a **🪶 Lite variants** table (9 rows, same-pkg replace-on-install semantics), fixed the stale `1.1.0-604` naming/versioning examples → `1.3.0-604`, stripped all 5 stale `⭐ *new in 1.1.0-604*` inline tags from the patches table (verified 0 remain), added a "Lite size-reduction strips" patch-table row + a full-vs-Lite Notes bullet, intro now states 18 APKs.

README on `gamehub-604-build` bumped (`c61f44d`, pushed `317fef0..c61f44d`): latest-stable badge link + ToC entry + What's new section all → v1.3.0-604; new section covers the two headline changes and demotes the v1.2.0-604 privacy-stack/PC-Game-Settings detail to a concise carryover note (per the established "latest release only in README" convention; full history stays on the release pages).


## 2026-05-16 — README accuracy pass + vibration-fix credits (v1.3.0-604)

README (`gamehub-604-build`, `313caa6`): "What it does" now says preload-free vibration + notes the per-variant ~34.5 MB Lite counterpart; new **🪶 Lite variants** subsection under Variants (strip list, same-pkg replace-on-install, built from never-merged `feature/lite-variant-tier1`); `PC-accurate vibration` patch heading flags the v1.3.0-604 preload-free rework; Credits row rewritten — TideGear PR #80 (original port) + PR #91 (preload-free winebus rework, used with explicit permission) + a new **GameNative** row (verified upstream `github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative`, PR #1214 lineage; my first-pass `github.com/GameNative` guess was wrong — verified via the local GameNative checkout's `upstream` remote per the always-verify rule).

Release notes (v1.3.0-604 GitHub release, via `gh release edit`): added a **🙏 Credits** section before Notes crediting the controller vibration fix — TideGear/GameHub-Vibration-Fix (PR #80 + #91, with permission) + GameNative (utkarshdalal, PR #1214 lineage), linking the README Credits for the full list.


## 2026-05-16 — v1.3.0-604 release-notes trims (user-requested)

Two further `gh release edit` passes on the v1.3.0-604 GitHub release (notes only; no APK/repo change):
1. Removed the entire **🔐 Stable signing — in-place updates from this release onward** section (header + 3 paragraphs). The brief "(stable keystore unchanged — installs in place)" parenthetical in the What's new intro, the **Signing** bullet in Notes, and the README signing callout were intentionally left as-is (out of scope).
2. Removed the **body** of the **✅ Steam game launches work end-to-end** section (the "v1.0.0-602's release notes…" paragraph + the ⚠ `xtask install components failed` blockquote) but **kept the header line** (with the ✅ check mark) per request — it now sits directly above `### Source`.

Final published v1.3.0-604 notes structure: title intro → ✨ What's new in 1.3.0-604 → ✅ Steam game launches work end-to-end (header only) → Source → Naming/versioning → Variants (full + 🪶 Lite tables) → Patches applied (details) → 🙏 Credits → Notes. No stale `1.1.0` references or `⭐ new in 1.1.0-604` tags remain.


## 2026-05-17 — Per-game GPU spoof feature (branch `feature/gpu-spoof-menu`)

### Motivation
Crysis 2 (CryEngine 3) shows *"Unsupported video card detected!"* then crashes after OK. The engine reads the adapter as `"GameFusion Driver" [vendor id = 0x5143, device id = 0x43051401]` — 0x5143 is Qualcomm (the Adreno), which CryEngine's GPU whitelist (NVIDIA 0x10DE / AMD 0x1002 / Intel 0x8086 only) rejects. Verified from a user screenshot. DXVK's `dxgi/d3d9/dxvk.customVendorId/customDeviceId` overrides exactly these fields.

### Feature — "GPU Spoof" per-game menu row + dialog
Direct structural clone of the vibration feature (4 patches + 3 extension classes), so it inherits the proven menu-injection trail from `[[bannerhub-revanced-menu-injection-playbook]]`.

New extension classes (`extensions/gamehub/.../com/xj/winemu/gpuspoof/`):
- `BhGpuSpoofController.java` — per-game persistence in stock `pc_g_setting<gameId>` SharedPreferences under `bh_gpuspoof_*` keys (export/import compatible, mirrors `BhVibrationController`); global fallback `bh_gpuspoof_prefs`. `applyGpuSpoof(EnvVars)` writes `<filesDir>/bh_gpuspoof_dxvk.conf` (dxgi+d3d9+dxvk customVendorId/DeviceId/DeviceDesc) and force-sets `DXVK_CONFIG_FILE` via reflection. Mode 0 = Off = stock, zero regression.
- `BhGpuSpoofSettingsActivity.java` — dialog: Off / GTX 1060 / GTX 1080 / RX 580 / UHD 630 / Custom (hex vendor+device+name fields shown for Custom). Saves immediately.
- `BhGpuSpoofMenuRowClick.java` — Function1/Function0 proxies + 3 row-append helpers + `maybeResolveCustomLabel`, mirroring `BhMenuRowClick`.

New patches (`patches/.../gamehub/gpuspoof/`):
- `GpuSpoofMenuRowPatch.kt` — 3 injections (Lx57;->a More Menu, ted.f, Lpzc;->j0) + Lxd3;->l1 resolver short-circuit (distinct `:bh_gpuspoof_resolve_fallthrough` label so it coexists with the vibration patch's index-0 head block).
- `GpuSpoofMenuLabelPatch.kt` — appends `bh_gpuspoof_label` = `GPU Spoof` (b64 `R1BVIFNwb29m`) to features.home CVR.
- `GpuSpoofManifestPatch.kt` — registers the Activity (exported=false).
- `GpuSpoofPatch.kt` — launch plumbing. Hooks `Lbg5;->a` (.locals 35, env builder). **Anchor verified by reading bg5.smali:** the app's sole `DXVK_CONFIG_FILE` write is at smali ~2472 inside the `:cond_15` (max-device-memory) conditional; `EnvVars` receiver is stably `v11`; "last EnvVars.a" is a trap (smali ~3099, after the main `return-void` at 3078, in a conditional tail). Correct anchor = the unconditional `ZINK_DESCRIPTORS` set right after `:cond_16` (past both the DXVK and MANGOHUD conditional merges) — inject `invoke-static {v11}, applyGpuSpoof` after it so our `DXVK_CONFIG_FILE` always wins.

Branched off `gamehub-604-build` per branch-per-patch workflow. Pushed (`ec5bc11`).

**CI:** `build_pull_request.yml` run 25994438414 → `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 34s` (2026-05-17). This workflow only runs `./gradlew build` — it confirms the Kotlin patches + Java extension **compile cleanly** but does NOT run revanced-cli, so the `firstMethod {}` anchors resolving in the real 6.0.4 APK and the smali injections applying are **NOT yet verified** (per the playbook anti-pattern: patcher SEVERE failures wouldn't even fail a CI run, and this run didn't invoke the patcher at all). **Patch-apply VERIFIED:** artifact-only `release.yml` dispatch (run 25994546875, version `1.3.0-604-gpuspoof-pre1`, stable unticked → 9 full-variant APK artifacts, no GH Release) → all 4 gpuspoof patches report `succeeded` **36/36 (4 patches × 9 variants)**, zero SEVERE/WARNING/skip. Confirms the `firstMethod {}` anchors resolve in the real 6.0.4 APK and every smali injection applies — including the `GpuSpoofPatch` `bg5` plumbing hook (ZINK_DESCRIPTORS anchor + v11 EnvVars register), all 3 menu-row injections, and the Lxd3;->l1 resolver short-circuit coexisting with the vibration patch. 9 APKs at run 25994546875 artifacts (`BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-604-gpuspoof-pre1-Patched-{Normal,Original,AnTuTu,alt-AnTuTu,Genshin,Ludashi,Normal-GHL,PuBG,PuBG-CrossFire}.apk`, ~114 MB).

Remaining: device test (Crysis 2 → GPU Spoof row → GTX 1060 → relaunch). Not merged. NB: user's daily driver is `banner.hub` (V6 **Lite**, never-merged `feature/lite-variant-tier1`); this branch builds the 9 **full** variants (different package) — to test in-place on their install, gpuspoof must later be brought into the Lite branch (as the preload-free vibration fix was). For now: sideload a full variant alongside Lite to validate the feature itself.

### 2026-05-17 — ANR-on-launch fix (strip l1/pzc/CVR from gpuspoof)

Device test of `…-Patched-alt-AnTuTu.apk` (pkg `com.antutu.benchmark.full`): "isn't responding" on launch. Verified via full (non-pkg-filtered) logcat: `ActivityTaskManager: Force finishing activity com.antutu.benchmark.full/com.xiaoji.egggame.MainActivity` → `ActivityManager: Killing … user request after error` → `Window{Application Not Responding}`. **ANR on MainActivity, not a crash** — crash buffer had no entry for the pkg (only stale 05-16 com.tencent.ig), no native tombstone, gpuspoof classes never logged.

Root-cause hypothesis (strong; exact ANR main-thread stack unobtainable — logcat-bridge blocks `/data/anr/`): the only gpuspoof code on the startup path was `GpuSpoofMenuRowPatch`'s `Lxd3;->l1` resolver short-circuit — uncached reflection (`Class.forName`+`getDeclaredField`+`get`) on the **main thread for every Compose string resolve**, stacked as a *second* such head-block atop the in-production vibration patch's identical one. First capture showed the freeze starting immediately after that resolver fired on the splash dialog. Vibration's single hook ships fine → the doubling is the delta.

Fix (also a sound scope cut): removed Injection 3 (library-list popup `Lpzc;->j0`/`Lz4e`), the `Lxd3;->l1` hook, `GpuSpoofMenuLabelPatch` (+ its `dependsOn`), and `BhGpuSpoofMenuRowClick.appendLibraryPopupRow`/`maybeResolveCustomLabel`/`LABEL_KEY`. Kept Injection 1 (More Menu `Lx57;->a`) + Injection 2 (tile popup `ted.f`) — both raw-String labels, **no l1, zero startup cost** — which already cover the per-game GPU-settings entry (where the Crysis 2 fix is reached). Net: gpuspoof now contributes nothing to MainActivity cold start. If the ANR persists after this build, gpuspoof is exonerated and it's a variant/device cold-start issue (next: stock-alt-AnTuTu comparison build).

### 2026-05-17 — pre2 device test: ANR fixed; spoof not applied → DXVK_CONFIG inline (pre3)

pre2 (`com.antutu.benchmark.full`): **app launches** (ANR fix confirmed — the l1 double-hook was the cause). Row appears in the More Menu (Injection 1; tile-popup Injection 2 not observed but More Menu is the relevant entry). Crysis 2 still showed "Unsupported video card / GameFusion 0x5143".

On-disk + logcat verification: `BhGpuSpoof: GPU spoof active: 8086:3e92 (Intel UHD 630)` logged at Wine launch; `bh_gpuspoof_dxvk.conf` written; `bh_gpuspoof_prefs.xml` mode=4. So our entire chain (bg5 hook → conf write → `EnvVars#a` reflection) **succeeds** — the failure is downstream. `pc_g_setting3939` shows the container = **Proton 10 ARM64EC + FEX + DXVK-2.4.1 + Turnip** (DXVK fully supports customVendorId). Root cause: the conf was written to `ctx.getFilesDir()` (`/data/user/0/<pkg>/files/...`) which is **not visible inside the Proton/FEX guest filesystem**, so DXVK could never open the file (GameHub writes its own dxvk.conf to a guest-visible dir `v0` it computes; we bypassed that).

Fix (`BhGpuSpoofController`): switch primary mechanism to DXVK's **inline `DXVK_CONFIG` env var** (DXVK ≥2.1; ';'-separated entries) — no file, no path/mount-namespace dependency, rides the same env channel as the working `DXVK_HUD`/`DXVK_ASYNC`. File + `DXVK_CONFIG_FILE` kept as belt-and-braces fallback. Diagnostic log now prints the full `DXVK_CONFIG` string. Rebuild = pre3. If Crysis 2 STILL sees 0x5143 after this, next hypothesis = the title's D3D9 goes through wined3d (no customVendorId) rather than DXVK d3d9 — would need the DXVK log (enable DXVK_LOG_LEVEL) to confirm.

### 2026-05-17 — pre4: library-popup parity (O(1) resolver) + inline DXVK_CONFIG

User requested GPU Spoof in the library per-game popup like PC Vibration. Re-added Injection 3 (`Lpzc;->j0`/`Lz4e`), `GpuSpoofMenuLabelPatch` (CVR `bh_gpuspoof_label`), the `Lxd3;->l1` resolver short-circuit, and `appendLibraryPopupRow` — **without** re-triggering the ANR: `maybeResolveCustomLabel` is now O(1) (tdi.a `Field` resolved once into a `volatile` static; every call = one `Field.get` + `String.equals`, no per-call `Class.forName`/`getDeclaredField`). pre3's inline-`DXVK_CONFIG` spoof fix is also in this build. pre4 (run 25995687479) green: all 4 patches incl. label resource apply 9/9, zero SEVERE. APK → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-604-gpuspoof-pre4-Patched-alt-AnTuTu.apk`. Retest matrix: (1) still launches (O(1) resolver didn't regress ANR), (2) row in library popup like PC Vibration, (3) Crysis 2 accepts spoofed GPU via inline DXVK_CONFIG.

### 2026-05-17 — pre4 ANR'd; DECISION: ship More-Menu-only (revert parity)

pre4 device test: ANR again. `ActivityManager` Reasons logged = `executing service …steam.cloud.SteamCloudSaveService` and `No response to onStartJob` — stock background components (which dispatch on the **main thread**), no "input dispatching timed out". Empirical isolation across builds is unambiguous: **l1 hook present (pre1 uncached / pre4 O(1)) → ANR; l1 hook absent (pre2) → launches**; user confirms other BannerHub v6 builds launch fine on this device. So a *second* `Lxd3;->l1` `addInstructions(0,…)` head-block stacked on the vibration patch's breaks startup regardless of `maybeResolveCustomLabel` cost (cost was a red herring; mechanism consistent with the [[revanced-trailing-label-footgun]] — the trailing-`:label`-at-index-0 workaround only holds when it's the *sole* index-0 injection; the stock service/job is just the ANR *victim* of the disrupted main thread).

User decision: **GPU Spoof = More Menu + tile popup only** (no library-list popup, no l1). Full PC-Vibration-parity would need a single shared l1 resolver (touching the shipping vibration patch — regression risk) and is dropped. Reverted the parity commit (`git revert 1e1fabd` → `b9dbf05`): GpuSpoofMenuLabelPatch deleted, Injection 3 + l1 + appendLibraryPopupRow/maybeResolveCustomLabel gone — **inline-`DXVK_CONFIG` Crysis 2 fix retained**. Net state = the working menu + the Crysis 2 fix, combined (never tested together before). Rebuild = pre5. Retest: (1) launches (no ANR), (2) Crysis 2 accepts spoofed GPU.

### 2026-05-17 — pre5: launch OK + spoof set, but Crysis 2 unchanged → pre6 DXVK-log diagnostic

pre5 device test: **app launches clean (no ANR)** — More-menu-only is stable. Spoof fully applied (`GPU spoof active 10de:1c03 (GTX 1060)`, DXVK_CONFIG + DXVK_CONFIG_FILE + conf file all confirmed on disk). Crysis 2 still "GameFusion 0x5143", no DX11/bin64 exe (SteamRIP Maximum Edition, bin32 only). **Two earlier inferences disproven by inspecting prefix `files/usr/home/virtual_containers/3939`:** `syswow64/d3d9.dll` → symlink to **DXVK-2.4.1-gplasync d3d9.dll**, so Crysis 2 DX9 runs on **DXVK d3d9, not wined3d**; and that symlink target is a `/data/user/0/<pkg>/files/...` path DXVK loads from, so that path **is** guest-visible (the pre3 file-path-invisibility theory was wrong too). DXVK d3d9 is the renderer, path reachable, spoof set — yet not applied. Real remaining suspects: env vars not propagating into the Proton-ARM64EC+FEX game process, or DXVK_CONFIG format. pre6 (`BhGpuSpoofController`): also set `DXVK_LOG_LEVEL=info` + `DXVK_LOG_PATH=<filesDir>` via the same EnvVars hook — DXVK log presence/absence is the conclusive test (propagation works vs not) and shows what DXVK does with our config. Stop inferring the failure layer; get the log.

### 2026-05-17 — pre7: full GameNative/Winlator GPU catalog + cascading-spinner UX

User asked to extend the preset list "as many as possible like GameNative/Winlator". Source identified locally (no APK decompile needed): `GameNative/app/src/main/assets/gpu_cards.json` — the same file Winlator ships. 289 entries → 286 after dropping 3 with overflowed (>0xFFFF) deviceIDs (`GeForce Go 7300/8200/GTX 860M`). Added a curated modern set the ~2021-era upstream list predates (RTX 30/40, RX 6000/7000, Intel Arc/B-series) → **313 cards total: 155 NVIDIA / 72 AMD / 86 Intel**.

- **New generated `BhGpuCards.java`** — `String[][][] CARDS` grouped by vendor, name-sorted, dup names suffixed ` (0xXXXX)`; helpers `locate()` (restore selection from stored hex) and `modelNames()`.
- **`BhGpuSpoofController`** — modes collapsed `OFF/GTX1060..UHD630/CUSTOM(5)` → `MODE_OFF=0 / MODE_SPOOF=1 / MODE_CUSTOM=2`; `PRESETS[][]` deleted; SPOOF & CUSTOM both apply the stored `bh_gpuspoof_{vendor,device,name}` triplet (storage/export keys unchanged).
- **`BhGpuSpoofSettingsActivity`** — Option 1 cascading-spinner UX: Mode (Off/Spoof a GPU/Custom) → Vendor spinner (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel + counts) → Model spinner repopulating per vendor; reopen restores via `locate()`. Native Spinner popups only — no ListView/eager inflation, ANR-safe per the pre1–pre4 lesson.

Zero patcher/CVR/asset/anchor change: the 3 patches reference only the menu row + activity (verified no preset coupling); `applyGpuSpoof(Object)` signature unchanged. All 3 Java files lint-compile clean vs android-34 android.jar (exit 0). **Caveat:** modern-card device IDs are well-known refs — sanity-check vs `pci.ids` before any *stable* ship; the 286 GameNative entries are upstream-clean. Build = artifact-only `release.yml` pre7. Carries pre5/pre6's inline-`DXVK_CONFIG` + DXVK-log diagnostic unchanged.

### 2026-05-17 — pre8: shrink the GPU Spoof dialog (user request, pre7 confirmed working)

pre7 device test: **works**. User asked to make the settings dialog smaller. `BhGpuSpoofSettingsActivity` only (pure extension Java, zero patcher/anchor change — same risk class as pre7):

- **Width:** fixed `dp(480)` → `Math.min(dp(340), screenW * 0.92)` so the card no longer spans edge-to-edge / overflows on phones.
- **Compact vertically:** root padding `dp(20/14)` → `dp(16/12)`, corner radius `12→10`, title bottom-margin `10→8`, desc top-margin `8→6`, btnRow top-margin `8→6`, label vertical padding `6/4 → 4/2`.
- **Smaller text:** title `16→14`, subtitle `12→11` (+ maxWidth `160→140`), label `13→12`, desc `11→10`, hexField & nameIn `13→12`.

No mode/preset/storage/anchor logic touched. Build = artifact-only `release.yml` pre8. Retest: dialog noticeably smaller, all 3 modes (Off/Spoof/Custom) + cascading spinners still usable.

### 2026-05-17 — pre9: compact spinner options + shorter dialog (user request, pre8 installed)

pre8 installed; user asked for smaller spinner *options* and a shorter dialog. The pre8 shrink left the spinners on Android's stock `simple_spinner_dropdown_item` (chunky ~48dp rows, big text). `BhGpuSpoofSettingsActivity` only (still pure ext Java, zero patcher/anchor):

- **`smallAdapter(String[])`** — new helper returning an `ArrayAdapter` that overrides `getView` (collapsed control: 12sp, `dp(3)` v-padding, single-line ellipsized) and `getDropDownView` (list rows: 12sp, `dp(10/5)` padding, single-line ellipsized), `setDropDownViewResource(simple_spinner_dropdown_item)`. Applied to all 3 spinners (Mode, Vendor, Model) — Mode/Vendor/Model dropdowns and the 313-entry Model list are far tighter.
- **Shorter:** spoofBox/customBox top-margin `10→6`, height cap `0.85→0.78` of screen.

No mode/preset/storage/anchor logic touched. Build = artifact-only `release.yml` pre9. Retest: spinner rows + dropdown list visibly smaller, dialog shorter, all 3 modes + cascading pickers still work.

### 2026-05-17 — pre10: fix invisible Custom-mode input fields (screenshot-confirmed)

pre9 device screenshot (`Screenshot_20260517-163400.png`): in **Custom** mode the 3 input fields (Vendor ID / Device ID / Adapter name) showed as blank white boxes. Root cause: the host theme renders `EditText` with a light/white background, but the dialog set white text + gray hint → **white-on-white, invisible**. `BhGpuSpoofSettingsActivity` only (pure ext Java, zero patcher/anchor):

- **New `styleField(EditText)`** — `GradientDrawable` dark fill `0xFF2A2A2A`, `dp(6)` corner, `dp(1)`/`0xFF4A4A4A` border; white text, hint `0xFF8A8A8A`; `dp(10/8)` padding; `dp(6)` top-margin. Applied to all 3 Custom fields (`hexField()` now calls it; `nameIn` styled inline, its redundant color setters removed).

No mode/preset/storage/anchor logic touched. Build = artifact-only `release.yml` pre10. Retest: Custom-mode fields legible (dark boxes, visible text/hint), spaced.

**Result:** pre10 run 26002042380 → **success**; `apk-alt-AnTuTu` delivered to `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-604-gpuspoof-pre10-Patched-alt-AnTuTu.apk`. UI-polish chain pre7→pre10 (full preset catalog → dialog shrink → compact spinners → legible Custom fields) all green; pre7 functionally device-confirmed, pre8/9/10 UI-only on top awaiting visual device test. Branch HEAD `e0853f4` `feature/gpu-spoof-menu`, NOT merged. Crysis-2-spoof-not-applied (pre6 DXVK-log diagnostic) remains open & orthogonal.

### 2026-05-17 — pre11: API-coverage expansion — wined3d + DX12/Vulkan prongs

Research (see [[gpu-spoof-api-coverage]]) established the DXVK-only feature covers DX9/10/11-on-DXVK only. User approved building **both** remaining prongs. **Extension-only, NO new smali patch** (the bg5 VK_ICD_FILENAMES set at decompile line 2233 uses the same `EnvVars.a(String,Object)` setter our ZINK-anchored hook runs *after* → last-write-wins, like DXVK_CONFIG_FILE):

- **Prong B — wined3d (`BhGpuSpoofController.upsertWineRegistry`)**: reads `WINEPREFIX` from `EnvVars`' public `LinkedHashMap a` (new `readEnv()` reflection helper), upserts `[Software\\Wine\\Direct3D]` `VideoPciVendorID`/`VideoPciDeviceID` (`dword:%08x`) + `VideoDescription` into `user.reg` in place — atomic temp+rename, one-time `user.reg.bhgpuspoof.bak`, fully non-fatal. Mirrors GameNative/Winlator `ContainerUtils`. Applied whenever a spoof is active (harmless to DXVK titles; no toggle).
- **Prong C — DX12/VKD3D + native Vulkan (`applyVulkanSpoof`)**: opt-in `KEY_DEEP` per-game pref. When on, reflectively reads `VK_ICD_FILENAMES`, swaps suffix `home/steamuser/.config/vulkan/icd.d/GameScopeVK_icd.json` → `share/vulkan/GameScopeVK_icd.json` (libGameScopeVK→libGameScopeV2, both ship in imagefs 1.4.1, base-agnostic), sets `GAMESCOPE_SPOOF_VENDOR_ID/DEVICE_ID` (`0x`+hex for strtoul base-0) + `DEVICE_NAME`. V2's `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2` hook ⇒ covers all Vulkan-backed APIs at once; **cost: disables frame-gen direct rendering** for that game.
- **UI (`BhGpuSpoofSettingsActivity`)**: new CheckBox "Also spoof DX12 / Vulkan games (turns off frame-gen for this game)", visible when mode≠Off, persists live via `ctl.setDeep()` + on Close; restores from `ctl.getDeep()`.

Pure ext Java (controller +234/−13, activity +24); no `.kt` patch / CVR / asset / anchor change; brace-balanced. Build = artifact-only `release.yml` pre11 → **run 26002591052 success**; `apk-alt-AnTuTu` delivered to `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-604-gpuspoof-pre11-Patched-alt-AnTuTu.apk`. Branch HEAD `b253894`. Retest: (1) DX9/10/11-on-DXVK still works (regression check), (2) toggle on → a DX12/VKD3D title sees the spoofed GPU, (3) wined3d-renderer title sees it, (4) frame-gen indeed off when deep on.

### 2026-05-17 — Reference: GameHub "GPU Passthrough" = renamed Native Rendering

User asked what the app's "GPU Passthrough" does. Verified in `gamehub_604_decompile/res/values/strings.xml:466`: `<string name="native_rendering_plus">GPU Passthrough</string>` — it is the **UI rename of the existing `NativeRendering` setting** (enum `NativeRenderingMode` Auto/Never/Always, MMKV slot 3), not a new feature. 6.0.4 also re-implemented it: old `DirectRendering` ASurfaceTransaction plane compositor deleted, absorbed into the Vulkan path; toggle now `XServer.setFlipEnabled` (libwinemu.so −25 KB). Function = direct flip/scan-out (GPU→display surface, skipping the X-server copy) → higher FPS / lower latency; Auto/Always/Never because the direct path is less flexible. **Relevance to this feature:** the flip path runs through `libGameScopeVK`; our pre11 deep DX12/Vulkan spoof swaps to `libGameScopeV2` which has DirectRendering removed — so GPU-Passthrough-Always + deep-spoof on the same game forces the slow copy path. That subsystem IS the "turns off frame-gen" cost on the deep-spoof checkbox. Full note in memory `reference_gamehub_gpu_passthrough.md` + master map § 26.23 / § 3.3.

### 2026-05-17 — CORRECTION: 6.0.4 GPU Passthrough is on/off ONLY (not Auto/Never/Always)

User flagged that on their 6.0.4 install GPU Passthrough is a plain on/off — no Auto/Never/Always, and no "Native Rendering" wording. Decompile trace confirms the user, corrects the prior entry's master-map-sourced enum claim: UI label `native_rendering_plus`=`GPU Passthrough` (`strings.xml:466`, id `0x7f1101ca`; `native_rendering_plus` is only the legacy resource *name*) → one MMKV bool **`key_native_rendering_enabled`, default false/OFF** (`tco.smali:407` `MMKV.decodeBool(...,false)`) → straight to **`XServer.setFlipEnabled(Z)`** at launch (`tco.smali:452`) and in-game sidebar live (`jk9.smali:839`). The `NativeRendering` bean has `enable:Z`+`mode:NativeRenderingMode`(Auto/Never/Always) but the factory builds `(enable=false, mode=null)` (`leo.smali` pswitch_6) and the flip decision reads only the boolean — the enum is vestigial in 6.0.4. memory `reference_gamehub_gpu_passthrough.md` + MEMORY.md index corrected.

### 2026-05-17 — 6.0.2→6.0.4 side-by-side saved + DiRT3/Crysis2 black-screen regression localized

(1) Binary-re-verified the GLES2→Vulkan rewrite against the exact libs (md5 match); consolidated 6.0.2-vs-6.0.4 side-by-side saved to master map § 26.23.8 + memory `reference_gamehub_602_vs_604.md`. Precision fix: 6.0.4 libxserver retains 121 `gl*` strings = X-server **GLX** dispatch (in both versions), NOT a surviving GLES2 renderer. Scope rule: renderer/native = byte-exact 6.0.2v6.0.4; broader app deltas = 6.0.1→6.0.4 only (6.0.2/6.0.3 never decompiled).

(2) User reports **DiRT 3 + Crysis 2 = black screen + audio on 6.0.4, worked on 6.0.2-era, GPU Spoof OFF/never used** (issue predates the spoof feature). Spoof + our patches excluded by the user's own account → only changed variable is the renderer rewrite; mechanism = removed libwinemu `ASurfaceTransaction` plane-compositor fallback → single Vulkan-only present path can't catch titles whose swapchain won't AHB-import on Turnip (black + sound = exact signature). NOT yet log-confirmed (need `getlog` during repro: libxserver `renderer_init failed`/`swapchain returned no images`/`no surface formats`/`vkAcquireNextImageKHR returned invalid image index`/`dlopen libvulkan.so failed` + DXVK d3d9.log). This is the concrete regression that fires the shelved **legacy-GLES2 renderer** plan's "revisit when" trigger — memory `project_bannerhub_revanced_legacy_gles2_renderer.md` + MEMORY.md index updated (trigger FIRED). Stock mitigations to try first: GPU Passthrough on/off, different Turnip+DXVK, force `winemu-xserver` backend if exposed. Real fix if unfixable in-app = legacy-GLES2 toggle or a separate 6.0.2-base BannerHub variant. No code change this entry — research/triage only.

### 2026-05-17 — DiRT3 black-screen ROOT-CAUSED: our own global deep-spoof (prior triage RETRACTED)

Log-server (`http://…:8080/events` SSE) + root logcat-bridge (`getlog --cat/--ls`) capture on the **pre11 alt-AnTuTu (non-Lite)** build. Prior entry's "spoof excluded → stock-6.0.4 renderer-rewrite regression" is **WRONG and retracted**. Evidence: `shared_prefs/bh_gpuspoof_prefs.xml` GLOBAL default = `bh_gpuspoof_mode=1` + **`bh_gpuspoof_deep=true`** (RTX 4080 / 10de:2704); DiRT 3 `pc_g_setting131962.xml` has no gpuspoof keys → inherits global → spoof+deep ON despite user believing it off (global-vs-per-game confusion). `dirt3_game_d3d11.log`: DXVK init **fully clean** (device "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080", swapchain B8G8R8A8 800x600 ×3 immediate, **zero errors**) then silence = textbook libGameScopeV2 signature (deep swaps `VK_ICD_FILENAMES`→libGameScopeV2, which has DirectRendering/present REMOVED). So **deep-spoof globally on bricks presentation for any game lacking a per-game override → black screen + audio.** Definitive test pending: spoof Off *globally* + deep off, relaunch. Side findings: DiRT3 & Crysis2 are **D3D11**-on-DXVK (their `*_d3d9.log`=0B, `*_d3d11.log` populated) — old "Crysis2=DX9" note corrected; both FEX + DXVK-2.4.1-gplasync + SMXZ_Turnip_v26.2.0_R4 + proton10-arm64x. **Design bug to fix: global-default `deep=true` is dangerous — deep should be per-game-only / not inherit from global, or global spoof must not silently apply the libGameScopeV2 swap.** Memory `project_bannerhub_revanced_gpu_spoof.md` + legacy-gles2 (trigger RETRACTED) + MEMORY.md corrected. No code change this entry.

### 2026-05-17 — DiRT3 spoof-off clean repro: pre-renderer hang; renderer-rewrite + spoof BOTH exonerated

Clean spoof-off run captured live (root bridge + log-server SSE), game left running. Verified `bh_gpuspoof_mode=0`, spoof conf NOT rewritten (hook didn't fire). `launchLog131962.txt` fresh (18:13) but **`dirt3_game_d3d11.log` never created** (stale 18:00) and SSE frozen 30s+ immediately after `dirt3_game.exe` PE load. ⇒ With spoof OFF, **DiRT 3 hangs pre-renderer — never loads d3d11.dll/DXVK**. Exonerates the 6.0.4 GLES2→Vulkan rewrite, the plane-compositor removal, AND our gpuspoof for the spoof-off case (none reached). Deep-spoof/libGameScopeV2 black-screen (18:00 run) remains a separate confirmed bug. DiRT3 spoof-off = longstanding pre-renderer early-exec hang, leading hypothesis GFWL (title needs it; `XLiveRedist` in prefix; needs `WINEDEBUG=+loaddll,+module,+seh` to pin). Fixes are GFWL-class (xliveless/disable GFWL/Box64-not-FEX). Memory (gpu-spoof, legacy-gles2 trigger NOT-fired, MEMORY.md) corrected. No code change.

### 2026-05-17 — DiRT3 ROOT CAUSE: ARM64EC+FEX vs x86_64+Box64 (clean 5.3.5-vs-6.0.4 A/B)

User ran DiRT3 on BannerHub 5.3.5 PuBG (`com.tencent.ig`) where it works; diffed its `launchLog131962.txt` vs the broken 6.0.4 alt-AnTuTu one (same game/exe/gameId 131962, same DXVK-2.4.1-gplasync/vkd3d-3.0.1/Pulse). Decisive delta: **WORKS = `wine_proton10.0-x64-1`, isArm64X=false, Box64 (Hybrid-Bionic "Extreme"); HANGS = `wine_proton10.0-arm64x-2`, isArm64X=true, FEX (ARM64EC)**. So DiRT3's pre-renderer hang = **ARM64EC+FEX failing on the 32-bit GFWL early-init**, not the GameHub version, not the GLES2→Vulkan renderer rewrite, not gpuspoof (all exonerated by this A/B). **Fix is a per-game container setting (no build): on 6.0.4 set DiRT3 (likely Crysis2 + other GFWL/old titles too) to a `wine_proton10.0-x64` base + Box64 translator.** Memory `project_bannerhub_revanced_gpu_spoof.md` updated; supersedes the GFWL-only hypothesis (FEX/ARM64EC is the proven lever).

### 2026-05-17 — Legacy-GLES2 THROWAWAY load test (go/no-go)

Per user request to test feasibility cheaply. New `LegacyGles2RendererTestPatch.kt` (resourcePatch, MuteUiSounds-pattern): force-overwrites 6.0.4 `lib/arm64-v8a/libxserver.so` + `libwinemu.so` with the 6.0.2 GLES2-era pair (bundled in `patches/src/main/resources/legacygles2/`, md5 libxserver e8eb89…/libwinemu 407f27…), always-on, NO toggle/pref/UI/DirectRendering stubs. Sole purpose: learn on-device whether the 6.0.2 pair loads/renders on the 6.0.4 Kotlin runtime or hard-crashes on JNI package drift (6.0.2 com.winemu.ui.XServer vs 6.0.4 com.winemu.core.server.XServer + deleted DirectRendering callbacks). Outcomes: UnsatisfiedLinkError→needs JNI shim; launches-but-blackscreen→pair coupling dead; renders→viable. Artifact-only release.yml test build; deliver alt-AnTuTu, capture launch logcat. Not for merge.

### 2026-05-17 — Legacy-GLES2 load test RESULT: JNI drift confirmed (outcome #1, feasible-with-shim)

test1 build (`b35d258`) device-tested: every game **instant SIGABRT on launch**. Abort: `JNI DETECTED ERROR ... java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: no ... method "Lcom/winemu/core/server/XServer;.setRenderingEnabled(Z)V"` at `XServer.<clinit>` → `libxserver.so JNI_OnLoad` → abort (pid `…:wine`). The 6.0.2 libxserver's JNI_OnLoad binds to 6.0.2's `XServer.setRenderingEnabled(Z)V`; 6.0.4 renamed it `setFlipEnabled(Z)V` (DirectRendering→flip). So **NOT package-drift (it found `com.winemu.core.server.XServer` fine — JNI_OnLoad uses FindClass+RegisterNatives) — it's METHOD-surface drift.** Verdict = predicted outcome #1: lib-pair coupling NOT disproven; legacy toggle is **feasible but requires a smali JNI shim** re-exposing the 6.0.2 native-method surface on 6.0.4's XServer (≥`setRenderingEnabled(Z)V` + the rest of 6.0.2 libxserver's RegisterNatives table + DirectRendering callbacks). Next scoping step: statically enumerate 6.0.2 libxserver.so's full JNI_OnLoad RegisterNatives {name,sig} list. Throwaway patch + bundled libs REVERTED from branch (would brick all subsequent gpuspoof builds). Memory `project_bannerhub_revanced_legacy_gles2_renderer.md` updated.

### 2026-05-17 — Legacy-GLES2 JNI surface enumerated; scope is two-tier

Static analysis of 6.0.2 libxserver.so (md5 e8eb89…, 0 Java_ exports, all-dynamic RegisterNatives) + libwinemu.so (407f27…, 36 static Java_ exports). libxserver = 11 natives on com.winemu.core.server.XServer; **10/11 name+sig identical to 6.0.4; only mismatch = `setRenderingEnabled(Z)V` (6.0.4 renamed → setFlipEnabled)**. libwinemu statically exports `Java_com_winemu_core_DirectRendering_00024Companion_{nativeInitialize,nativeSetSurfaceFormat,nativeStartTestClient}` against the 6.0.4-DELETED `com.winemu.core.DirectRendering`. **Scope: (1) trivial — +1 smali method `setRenderingEnabled(Z)V` on XServer fixes the load crash; (2) real work — restore deleted DirectRendering(+Companion) + port the 6.0.2 Java orchestration that drives it, to actually composite (lib-pair runtime still unproven).** Next = test2 (libs + tier-1 shim only, incremental). Memory `project_bannerhub_revanced_legacy_gles2_renderer.md` updated with the full surface.

### 2026-05-17 — Legacy-GLES2 test2 (tier-1 JNI shim) build

Added `BytecodePatchContext.addNativeMethod()` helper to BytecodeUtils (ImmutableMethod+ImmutableMethodParameter, `MutableMethod.Companion.toMutable as toMutableMethod`, modeled on addStaticFieldToExtension). `LegacyGles2RendererTestPatch.kt` now = 2 throwaway patches: (1) `legacyGles2XServerShimPatch` (bytecodePatch) adds native `setRenderingEnabled(Z)V` to `Lcom/winemu/core/server/XServer;`; (2) `legacyGles2LibSwapPatch` (resourcePatch, dependsOn the shim) overwrites libxserver.so+libwinemu.so with the 6.0.2 pair. Always-on, no toggle. Answers: does the app get PAST the JNI_OnLoad abort, and what next (render / next missing symbol / black via deleted DirectRendering orchestration). Artifact-only release.yml test2; deliver alt-AnTuTu; capture launch logcat. Not for merge.

### 2026-05-17 — Legacy-GLES2 test2b RESULT: load wall PASSED; next = setFlipEnabled call-direction

test2b (lib swap + added native `setRenderingEnabled(Z)V` on XServer) device result: **JNI_OnLoad no longer aborts** — 6.0.2 libxserver.so now loads (shim worked, RegisterNatives resolves). New crash, further along: `java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: No implementation found for void com.winemu.core.server.XServer.setFlipEnabled(boolean)` — 6.0.4's Java calls `setFlipEnabled` at launch (GPU-Passthrough flip), but the 6.0.2 lib only provides `setRenderingEnabled` (the 6.0.2 name for the same fn). Confirms it's ONE rename hit from BOTH directions (lib exposes setRenderingEnabled / app calls setFlipEnabled). Next (test3): redirect 6.0.4's ~2 `XServer->setFlipEnabled(Z)V` call sites (tco/jk9) → `setRenderingEnabled` (tiny method-ref swap). Then expect the real tier-2 wall (deleted DirectRendering orchestration / does it render). Throwaway now visibly = a 6.0.2↔6.0.4 JNI compat layer. Memory updated. Branch still has the throwaway patches (revert when done).

### 2026-05-17 — Legacy-GLES2 test3 (setFlipEnabled redirect) build

Added `BytecodePatchContext.redirectVirtualCalls(definingClass,fromName,toName,proto)` helper (BytecodeUtils; mirrors forEachLiteralValueInstruction iteration, matches by MethodReference so R8-letter-resilient, rebuilds invoke-virtual preserving regs via FiveRegisterInstruction + remove/addInstructions — no replaceInstruction in this patcher set). New `legacyGles2SetFlipRedirectPatch` bytecodePatch redirects the 2 `Lcom/winemu/core/server/XServer;->setFlipEnabled(Z)V` call sites (jk9.smali:839, tco.smali:452) → `setRenderingEnabled`. legacyGles2LibSwapPatch now dependsOn(shim, redirect). test3 = shim + redirect + lib swap. Artifact-only release.yml. Expected next: past both JNI walls → the real tier-2 question (deleted DirectRendering orchestration / does it composite). Throwaway; not for merge.

### 2026-05-17 — Legacy-GLES2 test3 RESULT: BOTH JNI walls cleared; old engine loads + game executes

test3 (lib swap + setRenderingEnabled shim + setFlipEnabled→setRenderingEnabled redirect) device run: **NO crash, NO JNI error** (no NoSuchMethodError, no UnsatisfiedLinkError anywhere). Logcat 20:46: `gamescope: vkCreateInstance app_name: dirt3_game.exe engine_name: DXVK` ×2, loads syswow64/d3d8.dll + wine i386 comdlg32.dll — i.e. **6.0.2 libxserver.so loaded successfully and dirt3_game.exe actually executed into DXVK Vulkan-instance bring-up** (~14s real run) before `:wine` died at 20:46:35 → WineActivity→MainActivity, user switched to Termux 20:46:43. JNI compat bridge (addNativeMethod + redirectVirtualCalls) WORKS. Inconclusive on render: not left running long enough, no DXVK device/render log written before it ended (same launch→switch-away pattern as prior runs; no logged crash for the :wine death). Next: left-running ≥90s capture (live SSE + DXVK log) to see render-or-DirectRendering-wall. Memory updated.

### 2026-05-17 — Legacy-GLES2 test3 RENDERS (milestone: toggle proven viable)

Background SSE auto-capture + logcat. Two runs: (1) **20:58 arm64x+FEX** → `err:wow:load_64bit_module failed ... c000007b` + `Could not find memory region containing address /wine` at run.exe wow64 bootstrap = **6.0.2 libwinemu can't do the ARM64EC/wow64 path** (predicted libwinemu-pairing blocker, real but path-specific; no JNI crash). (2) **21:01 DiRT3 on wine_proton10.0-x64-1 + Box64 (isArm64X=false)** → `WinEmuModule DevicePerformanceReporter fps=29` sustained durationSec 80→90→100→110, :wine pid 31363 alive, no crash = **THE 6.0.2 GLES2 libxserver+libwinemu pair LOADS AND RENDERS on 6.0.4 with the JNI bridge.** ⇒ **Legacy-GLES2 toggle is VIABLE.** Constraint: must pair with **x64/Box64** containers (arm64x/FEX bootstrap dies on 6.0.2 libwinemu). Tier-2 "deleted DirectRendering" did NOT block rendering on this path. Pending: user visual confirm (fps=29 telemetry says rendering; eyes = tiebreaker). Helpers `addNativeMethod`+`redirectVirtualCalls` are the proven shim primitives for the real feature. Memory updated.

### 2026-05-17 — Remove throwaway legacy-GLES2 patches (pre GPU-Spoof merge)

git rm the 3 throwaway files (LegacyGles2RendererTestPatch.kt + 6.0.2 libxserver.so/libwinemu.so) off feature/gpu-spoof-menu so GPU Spoof can merge clean to gamehub-604-build. Reusable BytecodeUtils helpers `addNativeMethod`/`redirectVirtualCalls` KEPT (generic; needed for the upcoming real renderer toggle). Learnings preserved in memory project_bannerhub_revanced_legacy_gles2_renderer.md (test1→test3: JNI bridge works, x64+Box64 runs but black-screen+sound = DirectRendering present path still required = tier-2 crux).

### 2026-05-17 — CORRECTION: legacy renderer DOES display (GoW on Proton-10-arm); DiRT3 is the outlier

User: God of War ran fine on the legacy renderer on wine_proton10.0-arm64x-2 (arm64x+FEX). Telemetry corroborates (session hit fps=310/299 @ gpuPercent=80 = heavy real rendering, not black). Both my prior swings were over-generalised from DiRT 3 (session-long problem child: GFWL/32-bit-wow64/c000007b): "PROVEN VIABLE" (telemetry-fooled) AND "black-screen, DirectRendering crux unsolved" (DiRT3 visual) were BOTH wrong. Corrected: **legacy GLES2 renderer DISPLAYS and works for real games (GoW end-to-end); deleted-DirectRendering is NOT a universal present blocker; arm64x not broken for legacy (c000007b was DiRT3 32-bit wow64).** Real toggle scope shrinks to gating the already-proven lib-swap+JNI-bridge behind a per-game pref. Plan doc + memory corrected. Lesson: never generalise DiRT 3 to the renderer; validate with a clean title.

### 2026-05-17 — Legacy-renderer-toggle Milestone 1: toggle plumbing (UI + pref + menu row)

On `feature/legacy-renderer-toggle`. Cloned the GPU-Spoof scaffold → renderer toggle (no swap yet; that is M2):
- `extensions/.../renderer/BhRendererController.java` — per-game+global pref `bh_renderer_mode` (0=New default / 1=Legacy) in `pc_g_setting<id>` + `bh_renderer_prefs`; get/setMode, reload, `isLegacyForGame/isLegacyForLaunchingGame` (M2 entry), sniffGameIdFromStack.
- `BhRendererSettingsActivity.java` — compact dialog (gpuspoof styling): Mode spinner New(Vulkan)/Legacy(GLES2) + inert-features/GFWL warning; persists on select + Close.
- `BhRendererMenuRowClick.java` — faithful clone of BhGpuSpoofMenuRowClick (More Menu Lx57;->a + tile popup ted.f; raw-String label, NO l1; Proxy over R8 Function1/0). ROW_LABEL "Renderer".
- `RendererMenuRowPatch.kt` — clone of GpuSpoofMenuRowPatch (Inj1 Lx57;->a + Inj2 ted.f); additive to the GPU-Spoof row (distinct label, same proven-safe append). `dependsOn(sharedGamehubExtensionPatch, rendererManifestPatch)`.
- `RendererManifestPatch.kt` — registers BhRendererSettingsActivity (exported=false, translucent).
All brace-balanced; auto-discovered patches. M1 = the row+dialog+persistence work and are device-testable now (selecting Legacy won't change rendering until M2 wires the conditional 6.0.2 lib-swap+JNI-bridge). Artifact-only build to verify compile + that the renderer menu injections resolve alongside gpuspoof's identical anchors.

### 2026-05-17 — Per-game-from-menu investigation: GameInfo.getServerGameId() is the source

User-confirmed: Vibration is global from BOTH More Menu and library popup too — the per-game gap is universal/pre-existing (all 3 use sniffGameIdFromStack = needs a running WineActivity; none at pre-launch menu → global). Decompile trace result: real per-game id = **`com.xiaoji.egggame.game.di.model.game.GameInfo` (kept-name, non-R8) → `getServerGameId()I`** (== pc_g_setting<id> / launchLog gameId). In scope in both `Lx57;->a(Lf37;…)` (More Menu) and `Lpzc;->j0(Laub;…)` (library popup); stock rows read it (pzc.j0 ~2146/2180/2192); Laub/Lf37 carry libraryGameId. **Shared fix:** capture in-scope GameInfo at each injection site, getServerGameId(), thread into click→settings Intent (replace sniffGameIdFromStack). Also recorded: GPU-Spoof & Renderer were never added to the library popup (Lpzc;->j0/Lz4e) — only Vibration has it (needs Lxd3;->l1; gpuspoof dropped it over the l1-ANR) → adding them must avoid a 2nd l1 head-block. Plan doc updated. Next: implement the shared GameInfo-capture mechanism (Renderer first, then retrofit GpuSpoof+Vibration), then add GPU-Spoof/Renderer library-popup rows w/o a 2nd l1 hook.

### 2026-05-17 — Step 1: shared per-game gameId-from-menu mechanism (Renderer)

`BhRendererMenuRowClick`: + `captureGameId(menuData)` (resolves gameId from menuData.toString() via the R8-stable token `ServerGameId\(value=(-?\d+)\)` / fallback `gameId=(\d+)` — == pc_g_setting<id>); + `volatile static sCapturedGameId`; handler instances bind it at construction; `invoke()` prefers boundGameId, falls back to sniffGameIdFromStack (in-game sidebar). `RendererMenuRowPatch`: + index-0 `invoke-static/range {p0 .. p0} -> captureGameId(Object)V` on BOTH builders (Lx57;->a More Menu p0=Lf37 GameDetailArgs; ted;->f tile popup p0=Lued — both verified `static final`). Single no-label once-per-menu-open invoke = no l1/ANR/trailing-label footgun. Mechanism is generic & R8-letter-proof → retrofit target for GpuSpoof+Vibration next. Artifact-only build to verify compile + smali (pN range invoke at idx0) + per-game on device.

### 2026-05-17 — Shared BhMenuGameId refactor (per-game for all 3 menu features)

Extracted capture into `extensions/.../common/BhMenuGameId.java` (captureGameId/getCaptured/resolve via R8-stable ServerGameId/gameId toString token) + `patches/.../common/MenuGameIdCapturePatch.kt` (ONE index-0 `invoke-static/range {p0..p0}` into BOTH builders Lx57;->a + Lted;->f, dependsOn sharedGamehubExtensionPatch). Renderer de-duped (BhRendererMenuRowClick → BhMenuGameId.getCaptured; RendererMenuRowPatch dropped its own capture, dependsOn menuGameIdCapturePatch). Retrofitted GPU Spoof (BhGpuSpoofMenuRowClick getCaptured-else-sniff; GpuSpoofMenuRowPatch dependsOn menuGameIdCapturePatch) + Vibration (BhMenuRowClick getCaptured-else-sniff; VibrationMenuRowPatch dependsOn += menuGameIdCapturePatch). One shared capture, three small handler consumers — no triplicate index-0 stacking. Build verifies all 3 coexist + compile.

### 2026-05-17 — Per-game fix #2: cover the library-LIST popup (Vibration's 3rd entry)

Device: GPU Spoof + Renderer now per-game (More Menu/tile popup) but Vibration still global — because Vibration also has a row in the library-LIST popup `Lpzc;->j0(Laub;Z…)` which MenuGameIdCapturePatch didn't cover (GPU Spoof/Renderer have no row there yet). Fix: (1) MenuGameIdCapturePatch + 3rd index-0 capture into `Lpzc;->j0` (static, p0=Laub; mirrors vibration's exact j0 predicate). (2) `BhMenuGameId.resolve()` now 2-pronged: toString token (Lf37 GameDetailArgs) THEN kept-name `com.xiaoji.egggame.game.di.model.game.GameInfo.getServerGameId()` located by VALUE type on the param or its declared fields (Laub.a:GameInfo) — R8-field-name-proof. Build to verify + device-test Vibration per-game from the library popup.

### 2026-05-17 — Vibration per-game ROOT CAUSE: Intent extra key mismatch (1-line fix)

Capture mechanism was fine (GPU Spoof/Renderer per-game proved it). Vibration stayed global because of a pre-existing key mismatch: `BhMenuRowClick` put the id under `"gameId"` but `BhVibrationSettingsActivity` reads `EXTRA_GAME_ID = "bh_vibration.gameId"` → settings activity always got null → `setContainerForSettings(null)` → global. Fixed: putExtra now uses `BhVibrationSettingsActivity.EXTRA_GAME_ID`. (GPU Spoof/Renderer were unaffected — their handler/activity keys already matched.) Build to verify Vibration now per-game from all 3 menus.

### 2026-05-17 — STATE SNAPSHOT (per-game saga) + memory synced

Branch `feature/legacy-renderer-toggle` HEAD `4ab5230`. Done: shared `BhMenuGameId` + single `MenuGameIdCapturePatch` (index-0 capture into all 3 builders Lx57;->a / Lted;->f / Lpzc;->j0; R8-proof via ServerGameId/gameId toString token + kept-name GameInfo.getServerGameId by value-type); Renderer de-duped; GPU Spoof + Vibration retrofitted to read getCaptured(); Vibration extra-key bug fixed (`4ab5230`, build 26010126663 verification pending). Device-confirmed per-game: GPU Spoof + Renderer (More Menu/tile popup). Pending: (a) verify Vibration per-game post-`4ab5230`; (b) Task #20 — add GPU Spoof + Renderer ROWS to library-list popup `Lpzc;->j0` without a 2nd l1 head-block; (c) Milestone 2 — Renderer toggle still UI/pref-only, conditional 6.0.2 lib-swap+JNI-bridge not wired. Caveat recorded in memory: `gamehub-604-build` gpuspoof (merged `792ae69`) lacks the per-game mechanism — only this branch has it; needs later merge. Memory updated: project_bannerhub_revanced_legacy_gles2_renderer.md + project_bannerhub_revanced_gpu_spoof.md.

### 2026-05-17 — Vibration per-game CONFIRMED WORKING on device

User confirmed: Vibration per-game settings now work end-to-end on device after the extra-key fix `4ab5230` (`putExtra` → `BhVibrationSettingsActivity.EXTRA_GAME_ID`, build 26010126663). All three per-game menu features are now device-verified per-game: **GPU Spoof + Renderer** (More Menu / tile popup) and **Vibration** (all three menus incl. the library-list popup `Lpzc;->j0`). The shared `BhMenuGameId` + single `MenuGameIdCapturePatch` mechanism is fully proven end-to-end. Branch `feature/legacy-renderer-toggle` HEAD `28de6c4`. Pending item (a) CLOSED. Remaining: (b) Task #20 — add GPU Spoof + Renderer ROWS to the library-list popup `Lpzc;->j0` without a 2nd `Lxd3;->l1` head-block (STARTING NOW); (c) Milestone 2 — Renderer conditional 6.0.2 lib-swap+JNI-bridge. Memory updated: project_bannerhub_revanced_legacy_gles2_renderer.md + project_bannerhub_revanced_gpu_spoof.md.

### 2026-05-17 — Task #20 IMPLEMENTED: GPU Spoof + Renderer rows in library-list popup (shared-resolver, no 2nd l1)

Added the missing library-list popup (`Lpzc;->j0`, `Lz4e(Lell,Lnw6,int)` rows) entry for **GPU Spoof** and **Renderer** — previously only Vibration had a row there. Hard constraint honoured: **NO 2nd `Lxd3;->l1` head-block** (that stacking ANR'd cold start, 2026-05-17 gpuspoof saga). Approach = **single shared l1 resolver**:
- `BhMenuRowClick.maybeResolveCustomLabel` (the method the ONE existing vibration-injected l1 head-block calls) extended from 1→3 sentinel keys: `string:bh_pc_vibration_label`→"PC Vibration Settings", `string:bh_gpuspoof_label`→"GPU Spoof", `string:bh_renderer_label`→"Renderer". Null-safe early-out unchanged.
- `BhGpuSpoofMenuRowClick` + `BhRendererMenuRowClick`: added `appendLibraryPopupRow(Object)List` (Unsafe-allocate `Lell`, reflect-set `Ltdi.a`=sentinel key / `Ltdi.b`=emptySet, `Lz4e(Lell,Lnw6,int)` ctor, Function0 proxy → own `invoke()`), exact mirror of the proven vibration helper. Stale "removed due to ANR" NOTE comments replaced with the shared-resolver rationale.
- `GpuSpoofMenuRowPatch` + `RendererMenuRowPatch`: added **Injection 3** into `Lpzc;->j0` — `return-object`-anchored `invoke-static appendLibraryPopupRow + move-result` (mirrors vibration Injection 3; this is a row-append before return, NOT an l1 head-block — the proven-safe coexistence pattern). Both now `dependsOn(vibrationMenuRowPatch)` so the single shared l1 hook is guaranteed present + applied first; header/dependsOn comments updated. No new `Lxd3;->l1` injection anywhere → zero ANR regression risk.

5 files edited, all brace-balanced. Chaining across the 3 patches into the same `Lpzc;->j0` return path is the same proven additive pattern as the More Menu Injection 1. Next: commit + push + artifact-only CI build to verify compile + 3-patch coexistence + smali resolves in real 6.0.4 APK, then device-test all 3 rows in the library-list popup (no ANR).

Committed `d57bd78`, pushed to `feature/legacy-renderer-toggle`. Artifact-only build (stable unticked) **run 26011229146** (`1.3.0-604-libpoprows-pre1`) → ✅ **GREEN**. Patches bundle compiled; all 9 variants patched; `Create GitHub Release: skipped` (artifact-only as intended). Patch-log scan (per the SEVERE-doesn't-fail-CI anti-pattern): **0 SEVERE**, and `"GPU Spoof menu row"`, `"Renderer menu row"`, `"PC Vibration Settings menu row"`, `"Per-game menu id capture (shared)"` all `succeeded` in the real 6.0.4 APK — the 3 `Lpzc;->j0` Injection-3 row-appends + the shared 3-key l1 resolver resolve cleanly and coexist. Task #20 implementation CI-verified.

### 2026-05-17 — Task #20 DEVICE-CONFIRMED (full variant)

User installed `BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-604-libpoprows-pre1-Patched-alt-AnTuTu.apk` and confirmed: **all 3 rows (GPU Spoof, Renderer, PC Vibration Settings) appear in the library-LIST popup**. App launched and reached the menus → **no cold-start ANR** (the entire point of the single-shared-l1-resolver design — validated). Task #20 functionally proven on the full variant. Click-behaviour (each row opens its per-game settings dialog scoped to the right game) not yet separately reported but the handlers are the same proven code already device-confirmed from the More Menu/tile popup. Remaining: bring this to the user's ACTUAL install (V6 **Lite** `banner.hub`), which needs the whole per-game feature set (this branch's delta), not just `d57bd78` — Lite (`feature/lite-variant-tier1`, off `gamehub-604-build`) lacks `BhMenuGameId`/`MenuGameIdCapturePatch`/Renderer patches/the extended l1 hook. Decision point surfaced to user (merge route).

### 2026-05-17 — Merge-delta analysis: feature/legacy-renderer-toggle → gamehub-604-build (decision PENDING)

Computed exact git delta `origin/gamehub-604-build...feature/legacy-renderer-toggle` = **10 commits, 13 files, +1434/−34** (2 docs-only: PROGRESS_LOG.md, docs/LEGACY_RENDERER_TOGGLE_PLAN.md). What a main merge would add:
1. **Shared per-game mechanism** (new): `BhMenuGameId.java` + `MenuGameIdCapturePatch.kt` → GPU Spoof becomes per-game *from the menu* (currently global-from-menu on main since gpuspoof merge `792ae69`; per-game only worked from the in-game sidebar).
2. **Entire new Renderer feature** (new): BhRendererController/SettingsActivity/MenuRowClick + RendererMenuRowPatch + RendererManifestPatch. ⚠️ **Milestone 2 NOT wired → the Renderer row+dialog are visible but INERT** (picking Legacy does nothing). This is the sole real trade-off of a main merge.
3. **Existing-feature mods**: BhMenuRowClick (+48: vibration EXTRA_GAME_ID per-game fix + shared 3-key l1 resolver), BhGpuSpoofMenuRowClick (+62), GpuSpoofMenuRowPatch (+83), VibrationMenuRowPatch (+3) → Vibration + GPU Spoof go per-game; all 3 get the Task #20 library-list-popup row.
Clarified: the gpuspoof global-default `deep=true` black-screen bug is ALREADY on gamehub-604-build (came with `792ae69`) — this merge does NOT introduce it; the new per-game mechanism is actually a prerequisite for the proper per-game-`deep` fix. Confirmed to user that GPU Spoof itself already shipped to main at `792ae69` (verified via git, not memory). **Routing decision still OPEN** — options on the table: (A) merge → gamehub-604-build then Lite; (B) merge → Lite branch only; (C) fix deep-spoof first; (D) verify row clicks on full variant before any merge. Mitigations for the inert-Renderer concern noted: hold merge until M2, or strip/hide the Renderer row in a main-merge variant. Verify: patches `succeeded` 9/9 each, 0 SEVERE, the 3 Lpzc;->j0 Injection-3 row-appends + the shared 3-key l1 resolver all resolve in the real 6.0.4 APK. Then device-test: GPU Spoof + Renderer + Vibration rows all appear in the library-LIST popup AND no MainActivity ANR on cold start (the whole point of the shared-resolver design).

### 2026-05-18 — Milestone 2 IMPLEMENTED (xserver-only-first): conditional 6.0.2 libxserver swap + JNI bridge, per-game gated

User picked **xserver-only first** for the libwinemu timing risk (7 early clinit loaders lock libwinemu to first-loaded copy; libxserver loads only at `XServer.<clinit>` = game-session time, so it is the clean, ordering-proof first cut; GoW rendered fine on the full pair so xserver-only may already suffice).

Wired the proven test1→test3 mechanism (GoW device-confirmed 2026-05-17) behind the per-game pref so New mode is provably stock (zero regression):

1. **`RendererLibBundlePatch.kt`** (resource, additive) — bundles 6.0.2 `libxserver.so` (md5 `e8eb894825da66cca0fc59b242ac0ad5`, recovered from throwaway commit `cee31f4`) into the APK as `lib/arm64-v8a/libxserver_legacy.so` ALONGSIDE the untouched stock 6.0.4 lib. Anchors on the stock lib's existing ABI dir; asserts stock present, never overwrites it.
2. **`BhRendererController` M2 methods** — `loadXserver(name)` (resolves launching gameId; Legacy → `System.load(libxserver_legacy.so)` via nativeLibraryDir or APK-zip fallback, else stock `System.loadLibrary` bit-identically; any legacy failure falls back to stock so it can never brick); `flip(xserver, flag)` reflective dispatcher → `setRenderingEnabled` (legacy lib) vs `setFlipEnabled` (stock); decision FROZEN at load time (`legacyActive`/`legacyDecided`) so flip never invokes an unbound native; `resolveLegacyLib` (nativeLibDir → cache-extract fallback for `extractNativeLibs=false`).
3. **`redirectVirtualToStatic`** helper added to `BytecodeUtils.kt` next to `redirectVirtualCalls` — rewrites `invoke-virtual {recv,args} cls->fn` → `invoke-static {recv,args} target`; needed because `redirectVirtualCalls` is a *global by-name* swap and a virtual target on XServer would self-recurse.
4. **`RendererSwapPatch.kt`** (bytecode) — `addNativeMethod` XServer `setRenderingEnabled(Z)V` (so legacy lib's RegisterNatives binds; harmless unbound under stock); rewrites `XServer.<clinit>`'s single `System.loadLibrary` → `BhRendererController.loadXserver`; `redirectVirtualToStatic` on the exactly-2 `setFlipEnabled(Z)V` call sites (`jk9:839 {v0,v1}`, `tco:452 {v8,v6}`) → `BhRendererController.flip`. `dependsOn(sharedGamehubExtensionPatch, rendererManifestPatch, rendererLibBundlePatch)`.

libwinemu deliberately NOT gated (xserver-only-first). Next: CI artifact-only build to verify compile + patches resolve 9/9 / 0 SEVERE in real 6.0.4 APK, then device-test Legacy toggle on a known-good title (GoW).

### 2026-05-18 — M2 pre1 CI: bundle+manifest+menu-row ✅, swap ✗ (CME) → fixed

Run 26022546201 green-but-not-applied (SEVERE-doesn't-fail-CI). Scan: "Legacy renderer libxserver bundle" / "Renderer settings activity" / "Renderer menu row" `succeeded` 9/9; **"Legacy renderer conditional swap" SEVERE 9/9** — `Caused by: java.util.ConcurrentModificationException at BytecodeUtils.redirectVirtualToStatic`. Root cause: `classDefs.getOrReplaceMutable(classDef)` structurally replaces the entry in the live `classDefs` set while the enclosing `classDefs.forEach` iterates it (latent in the copied `redirectVirtualCalls`, which no shipping patch actually invokes — `redirectVirtualToStatic` is the first real use). Fix: snapshot candidate classDefs via `classDefs.filter { … }` before the mutate loop + `classDef.methods.toList()`. Left the unused original `redirectVirtualCalls` untouched (minimal blast radius). Re-triggering pre2.

### 2026-05-18 — M2 pre2 CI ✅ VERIFIED

Run 26022795219: **0 SEVERE**; all 4 renderer patches `succeeded` 9/9 in real 6.0.4 APK across every variant — "Legacy renderer conditional swap", "Legacy renderer libxserver bundle", "Renderer menu row", "Renderer settings activity". CME fix confirmed. Milestone 2 is implemented + CI-verified (xserver-only-first). Plan doc updated with Status block. **Milestone 3 next:** device-test Legacy toggle on a known-good title (GoW); requires the feature on the user's actual install (V6 Lite `banner.hub`) → cherry-pick into `feature/lite-variant-tier1` (same as preload-free vibration landing).

### 2026-05-18 — M3 diagnostic build (Patches A+B) + FULL-PAIR libwinemu swap

Device-pulled the last 2 GoW launches under M2 pre2 (alt-AnTuTu `com.antutu.benchmark.full`, `bh_renderer_mode=1`): both bootstrapped, ran ~40 s @ 600 %% CPU, `:wine` died fg-TOP, **no tombstone, GoW_d3d11.log stale (05-17 15:56), no wine_debug.log** → never reached D3D11; died pre-render. Same shape as test3.

Built a THROWAWAY diagnostic (not for merge; gated by `BhRendererDiag.DIAG`):
- **Patch A** — `BhRendererDiag` fsync'd per-line file logger (`<files>/bh_renderer_diag.log`) threaded through `BhRendererController.loadXserver`/`loadWinemu`/`flip` (entry, resolveLegacyLib path+len+md5-vs-expected, LOAD_OK/FAIL, stock fallback, XSERVER_CLINIT_DONE, flip branch/flag/caller/result) + 1 Hz heartbeat (how far past the swap before `:wine` death).
- **Patch B** — `RendererDiagEnvPatch` injects `BhRendererDiag.applyDiagEnv` at GpuSpoofPatch's proven `Lbg5;->a` ZINK_DESCRIPTORS anchor; reflective EnvVars#a sets `WINEDEBUG=+loaddll,+module,+process,+seh,+pid,+timestamp,fixme-all` + `FEX_SILENTLOG=0` + `FEX_OUTPUTLOG=<files>/fex_diag.log` ONLY when Legacy active for the launching game (FEX log survives kill -9, unlike host-swallowed wine stderr).
- **FULL-PAIR (user decision)** — also swap 6.0.2 libwinemu (test3's proven pair). `redirectStaticLibLoad("winemu", loadWinemu)` (new BytecodeUtils helper) rewrites every `System.loadLibrary("winemu")` early loader; `RendererLibBundlePatch` now bundles BOTH `libxserver_legacy.so` (md5 e8eb89…) + `libwinemu_legacy.so` (md5 407f27…, verified from GameHub_6.0.2.apk) additively; `loadWinemu` idempotent + falls back to stock, decision ownership stays with loadXserver so flip()'s frozen contract is unchanged. Concession: libwinemu can't be strictly per-game (early loaders) — resolves per `:wine` launch via sniff+global.

`rendererSwapPatch` dependsOn `rendererDiagEnvPatch` so the diag patch is pulled in. CI: artifact-only `1.3.0-604-rendererm2-fullpair-diag-pre1`. Next: deliver alt-AnTuTu APK, GoW launch left running ≥90 s with Legacy set, pull the 3 logs via root bridge → decision table resolves which of the 4 hypotheses holds.

#### CI ✅ + APK delivered (post-build, 2026-05-18)

Run [26025275469](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26025275469) success; log-scanned (SEVERE-doesn't-fail-CI guard): **no real `SEVERE:`** (earlier grep hits = an echoed code-comment string, not patch failures); all 5 renderer/diag patches `succeeded` **9/9** — "Legacy renderer conditional swap" (holds the `redirectStaticLibLoad("winemu",…)` call), "Legacy renderer libxserver bundle" (now both 6.0.2 libs), "Legacy renderer diagnostic env (THROWAWAY)", "Renderer menu row", "Renderer settings activity". 9 variant APKs produced.

**Delivered:** `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-604-rendererm2-fullpair-diag-pre1-Patched-alt-AnTuTu.apk` (md5 `72bca817d6b7d1b298ea23566158ee82`, pkg `com.antutu.benchmark.full`). Same workflow/keystore as M2 pre2 → in-place update expected; if Android refuses on signature, uninstall first (wipes `bh_renderer_mode` + game library → re-set Legacy + re-import GoW).

**Caveat:** green "conditional swap succeeded" only proves RendererSwapPatch ran without throwing; `redirectStaticLibLoad` silently no-ops on 0 `loadLibrary("winemu")` matches (doesn't fail CI). `loadWinemu` wiring is confirmable ONLY from the device `bh_renderer_diag.log` `WINEMU`/`loadWinemu entry` lines.

**Run procedure (awaiting user):** install → confirm Renderer=Legacy for GoW → launch GoW, screen on, **left running ≥90 s** (`:wine` self-dies ~40 s; staying distinguishes fixed-timeout watchdog kill vs real progress) → pull (no manual capture): `getlog --cat /data/data/com.antutu.benchmark.full/files/bh_renderer_diag.log`, `…/files/fex_diag.log`, `getlog -n 40000 com.antutu.benchmark.full`.

**Decision table:** `WINEMU_LOAD_OK`+`LOAD_OK legacy libxserver`→GoW renders = full pair fixes it, xserver-only WAS the cause (pairing hypothesis confirmed); loads but still dies = deeper than lib pairing; no `WINEMU` lines = winemu redirect found 0 sites (rework redirect); md5 `MISMATCH!` = bundle/extract corruption; `LOAD_OK`+heartbeats stop ~40 s + FEX log clean = loaded/no-composite → host watchdog kill = deleted-DirectRendering tier-2 wall; `fex_diag.log` fatal `c000007b`/wow64 = FEX/arm64x death, renderer is a red herring for GoW.

## 2026-05-18 — M3 full-pair device result + forced-enable experiment (branch `feature/legacy-renderer-toggle`)

### Full-pair diag device run — root cause found
User ran 3 GoW launches on `…rendererm2-fullpair-diag-pre1` (pkg `com.antutu.benchmark.full`): L1 Legacy=black, L2 Vulkan/stock=working gameplay, L3 Legacy=black. Logcat buffer rolled (AnTuTu floods it); `bh_renderer_diag.log` fsync'd so it survived; `fex_diag.log` 0 B; `GoW_d3d11.log` stale (05-17 15:56) → game never reached DXVK/FEX under Legacy.

**Decisive findings from the diag log:**
1. **Full-pair bundle correct & loads** — `WINEMU_LOAD_OK legacy libwinemu` md5 `407f274d…` MATCHES 6.0.2; `LOAD_OK legacy libxserver` md5 `e8eb8948…` MATCHES 6.0.2; `XSERVER_CLINIT_DONE (legacy)`. The "`redirectStaticLibLoad` may no-op on 0 sites" caveat is **resolved — it fired**.
2. **Process does NOT die** — heartbeats unbroken n=0→n=42+, no tombstone/SIGABRT. **Full pair fixed the M2-pre2 ~40 s crash** (the missing lib *was* libwinemu, as hypothesised).
3. **Black + alive-forever = the deleted-DirectRendering tier-2 wall, confirmed.**

**Root cause:** `flip()` logs exactly ONCE per legacy launch — `branch=setRenderingEnabled enabled=false … OK` — and is never called again. The test2b "`setFlipEnabled`↔`setRenderingEnabled` = name-drift rename" was a *signature* match, not *semantic*: 6.0.4 `setFlipEnabled(Z)` = GPU-passthrough flip (default OFF → false); 6.0.2 `setRenderingEnabled(Z)` = master switch that turns the GLES2 renderer ON, formerly driven by the **6.0.4-deleted `com.winemu.core.DirectRendering`**. We pass 6.0.4's passthrough flag (false) into 6.0.2's renderer-enable switch → libs load, compositor present, renderer never enabled/driven → black, alive forever.

### Forced-enable experiment (user chose cheap test over full port)
Commit `55b3422` (off `ea2eef9`): one-line THROWAWAY in `BhRendererController.flip()` — `effEnabled = legacy ? true : enabled`; legacy branch now always invokes `setRenderingEnabled(true)` regardless of the 6.0.4-side flag; diag logs `FORCED->true (M3 experiment)` + `eff=`. Full-pair + all diag logging retained. **REVERT before any M2 ship.**

**CI ✅** run [26027685582](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26027685582) completed/success, log-scanned **0 SEVERE**, all renderer patches `succeeded` 9/9 ("Legacy renderer conditional swap" / "libxserver bundle" / "diagnostic env (THROWAWAY)" / "Renderer menu row" / "Renderer settings activity").

**Delivered:** `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-604-rendererm3-forceenable-pre1-Patched-alt-AnTuTu.apk` (md5 `7b298d4a932a24d0c298cd1e24484ed7`, 116 MB, pkg `com.antutu.benchmark.full`). Same workflow/keystore → in-place update expected; signature refusal fallback = uninstall (wipes `bh_renderer_mode` + library).

**Caveat for reading the result:** flip() fires ONCE at clinit time, surface almost certainly not yet ready. Still-black could mean EITHER the lib pair can't self-drive (→ full DirectRendering port) OR `setRenderingEnabled(true)` was called too early and needs re-assertion post-`surfaceChanged` (→ deferred re-call, still cheaper than full port). Lit screen → 6.0.2 renderer self-drives once enabled → M2 reduces to wiring the enable correctly.

**Run procedure (awaiting user):** install → Renderer=Legacy for GoW → launch, screen on, **left running ≥90 s** → pull `getlog --cat /data/data/com.antutu.benchmark.full/files/bh_renderer_diag.log` (confirm `FORCED->true (M3 experiment)` + `eff=true` on the FLIP line), `…/fex_diag.log`, `getlog -n 40000 com.antutu.benchmark.full` — capture promptly before the buffer rolls.

## 2026-05-18 (cont.) — M3 forced-enable DEVICE-CONFIRMED, cleanup shipped, verification blocked → root-bridge v1.3.0 (branch `feature/legacy-renderer-toggle`)

### M3 forced-enable result — ✅ GAME SCREEN (decisive positive)
`forceenable-pre1` device run, `bh_renderer_diag.log` 06:53: both 6.0.2 libs md5-MATCH (`libwinemu_legacy.so` `407f274d…`, `libxserver_legacy.so` `e8eb8948…`), `LOAD_OK legacy libxserver -> legacyActive=true`, `XSERVER_CLINIT_DONE (legacy)`, then `[FLIP] … FORCED->true (M3 experiment) … legacyActive=true` → `flip(setRenderingEnabled) OK eff=true`; heartbeats unbroken, no tombstone. User confirmed **game screen**. **PROVEN: the 6.0.2 GLES2 renderer self-drives once `setRenderingEnabled(true)` is called — no DirectRendering RE port needed.** Root cause was the identified semantic mismatch (6.0.4 fed its passthrough `false` into the 6.0.2 renderer master-switch).

### Cleanup shipped (commit `44b2e4e`)
Deleted `BhRendererDiag.java` + `RendererDiagEnvPatch.kt`; stripped all diag log/heartbeat/md5/flipCaller + the `rendererDiagEnvPatch` dependsOn; promoted the forced-true to the permanent documented rule in `BhRendererController.flip()` (javadoc explains 6.0.2 `setRenderingEnabled` = renderer master-switch ≠ 6.0.4 `setFlipEnabled` passthrough). Kept the proven full 6.0.2 pair bundling + swap. Fixed stale "xserver-only-first" comments. Author The412Banner, no Claude co-author. **NO merge to gamehub-604-build / NO Lite port yet** (user: clean+rebuild on branch first).

### Clean build — ✅ CI green
Artifact-only `release.yml` run **26029782656** (`--ref feature/legacy-renderer-toggle`, `version=1.3.0-604-renderer-clean-pre1`, `stable=false`): completed/success, log-scanned **0 SEVERE**, renderer patches `succeeded` all 9 variants, throwaway diag-env patch correctly ABSENT. APK delivered `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-604-renderer-clean-pre1-Patched-alt-AnTuTu.apk` md5 `19415351da8a3b46692c4dddf2d4e805`.

### Verification of the CLEAN build — BLOCKED, not yet proven
Device: Legacy SELECTED (`bh_renderer_mode=1` global + per-game 131962/3939/49908). But 6.0.2-libs-loaded NOT durably provable for the clean build: logcat flooded by AnTuTu (`getlog` logcat 0 lines); GameHub Log Server (`http://192.168.12.242:8080/` SSE `/events`) carries ONLY wine stdout/stderr — not Android logcat, so the kept `BhRenderer` `Log.i` markers don't appear; `bh_renderer_diag.log` stale (06:53, old forceenable run); `/proc` + `/data/app` outside root-bridge allowlist; app cache empty by design (native-extract path). GoW/d3d logs stale (05-17 15:56). Honest status: selection proven, load NOT proven for clean build (strong inference only — flip()/load logic byte-identical to the proven forceenable build).

### Root-bridge fix → logcat-bridge v1.3.0 (built, awaiting user flash+reboot)
Added read-only `proc <pid> <leaf>` verb (whitelist maps|cmdline|status|comm|smaps_rollup|stat|wchan|oom_score|cgroup|environ; numeric-pid; cat-only; `/proc` kept out of write allowlist). Client `getlog --proc <pid> <leaf>` (symlinked client already live). Zip `/storage/emulated/0/Download/logcat-bridge-magisk-v1.3.0.zip` (supersedes never-flashed v1.2.0). User WILL flash + reboot, relaunch GoW on Legacy, then return.

### RESUME (next session, after user returns)
1. `getlog --ping`→pong; `getlog --proc 1 comm`→ not "unknown verb" (confirms v1.3.0 live).
2. `getlog --ps` → find `com.antutu.benchmark.full` `:wine`/`:winemu` child pid.
3. `getlog --proc <pid> maps` → grep `libxserver_legacy.so` + `libwinemu_legacy.so`.
   - both present = DEFINITIVE proof clean build loads 6.0.2 pair → cleanup validated → MERGE to `gamehub-604-build` (NOT Lite-first), test there, then refresh Lite.
   - only stock libs = cleanup regressed the load path → investigate, do NOT merge.
4. Then decide optional permanent breadcrumb (one line to `getFilesDir()/bh_renderer.log` in legacy branch — prod observability, not the stripped diag harness).
Mergeable delta vs `gamehub-604-build`: 18 commits/18 files/+2073−34, no junk; only conscious change = GPU Spoof global→per-game-from-menu; +4.6 MB (2 .so).

## 2026-05-18 — Clean build BIDIRECTIONALLY verified LIVE → MERGED to gamehub-604-build → artifact build

### Verification (logcat-bridge v1.3.0 `--proc` verb, live GoW, full pkg `com.antutu.benchmark.full`)
RESUME plan executed. Bridge v1.3.0 proc verb confirmed live post-reboot. Both renderer modes proven against the live running GoW `:wine` process — DEFINITIVE, not inferred from the (stale) diag log:
- **Legacy run** (pid 8652): `/proc/8652/maps` = `libxserver_legacy.so` + `libwinemu_legacy.so`, NO stock. `bh_renderer_diag.log` correctly NOT freshly written (diag stripped) — corroborates this is the clean build.
- **Vulkan run** (pid 15133, same APK install hash `XkQ1IwHRAfdeZx0zIdv8OA==`): `/proc/15133/maps` = stock `libxserver.so` + `libwinemu.so` + `/vendor/lib64/hw/vulkan.adreno.so` + `/system/lib64/libvulkan.so`, NO `_legacy`.
Same APK toggles both ways cleanly, no regression either direction. Cleanup (`44b2e4e`) validated. (Capture-method note: `getlog --proc` sometimes writes a `/home/*.txt` file, sometimes prints maps to stdout — handle both.)

### Merge
`git checkout gamehub-604-build` (was `792ae69`, == origin) → `git merge --no-ff feature/legacy-renderer-toggle` → merge commit **`01b2f4d`** (18 files, +2101−34, 2 bundled 6.0.2 .so, no conflicts — gamehub-604-build was fully contained in the feature branch). Author The412Banner, no Claude trailer. Pushed `792ae69..01b2f4d gamehub-604-build`. Brings: per-game Vulkan↔legacy renderer swap (forced-enable permanent, diag stripped); shared `BhMenuGameId`+`MenuGameIdCapturePatch` (conscious change: GPU Spoof global-from-menu → per-game-from-menu); Task #20 library-list-popup rows.

### Artifact-only CI
`gh workflow run release.yml --ref gamehub-604-build -f version=1.3.0-604-renderer-merged-pre1` (stable defaulted false = artifact-only prerelease). Run **26035851236** (https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26035851236), queued.

### NEXT
- Watch run 26035851236 → green + 0 SEVERE + renderer/menu patches succeeded 9/9.
- Then refresh dependent Lite branch `feature/lite-variant-tier1` off the new `gamehub-604-build` (NOT Lite-first) and re-cut the Lite artifacts.
- M3 device-test on the user's actual **Lite** (`banner.hub`) install — the only open device-test gap (full-pkg is proven bidirectionally).

### CI RESULT — run 26035851236 ✅ GREEN

## 2026-05-18 — Offline component picker fix (components + ordering + Wine/Proton containers) — DEVICE-CONFIRMED, MERGED

**Problem:** On 6.0.4, offline, the per-game pickers (GPU driver, DXVK, VKD3D, FEX/Box64 translators, Wine/Proton container) showed only the server-recommended/built-in set — never the user's already-downloaded components, despite them being on disk + catalogued in `sp_winemu_unified_resources.xml`. The prior `OfflineComponentCachePatch` (mci.a hook) was forensically proven inert on 6.0.4 (wrong subsystem).

**Root cause (model-free, sink-verified after ~8 refuted hypotheses):** pickers are fed by `gof.a(ComponentType,…)` (components, via `simulator/v2/getComponentList`) and `gof.c(Continuation)` (containers, via `getContainerList`); both run offline but the network fetch fails → empty. `zxf.a`/`zxf.c` unwrap a uniform sealed result `Lo55;` → `Ln55;`(success).a = `List<EnvLayerEntity>` (NOT the `gof.b`-internal `BaseResult`/`Lc91;`). Not `myo`/`j7o`/`api_cache`/`so7` (all empirically eliminated).

**Fix (`offlineComponentListPatch`):** replace `gof.a` body → `OfflineComponentList.dispatch` (offline → `n55(List<EnvLayerEntity>)` synthesised from `sp_winemu_unified_resources` `COMPONENT:` entries filtered by `ComponentType.type`, `Unsafe.allocateInstance` + reflective field-set; online/fail → reflective `gof.b` passthrough). Add `gof.c` index-0 conditional short-circuit → `OfflineComponentList.getContainers()` (`CONTAINER:` entries; Wine/Proton). Stable-sort by `OfflineComponentOrder` (generated canonical catalog order) so DXVK/GPU match online exactly (newest-at-bottom, curated interleaving). Fully fail-safe → original path on any error. Removed dead `OfflineComponentCachePatch` + `PickerCacheFallback`.

**Verification:** device-confirmed on `banner.hub` Normal-Lite offline — `bh_offline_list.log`: `getContainers built=10 OK`, `getList type=1 built=36 / type=2 built=263 / type=3 built=46 / type=4 built=7 OK`; pickers populate with downloads + built-ins, DXVK/GPU correctly ordered; online byte-identical; no regression.

**Merge:** `fix/offline-picker-merge` → `gamehub-604-build` `--no-ff` (`dbd7554`). README patch-catalog section rewritten (was "⚠ currently broken"). NEXT: refresh `feature/lite-variant-tier1` off new `gamehub-604-build`; CI-validate (release.yml prerelease, expect 0 SEVERE).

## 2026-05-18 — Per-game settings isolation: GPU Spoof model STILL resets to first entry (pre3)

**Branch:** `fix/per-game-settings-isolation` (off `gamehub-604-build`).

**Symptom (device, pre2 build `9ccbf47`):** GPU Spoof — pick vendor + model → Save → reopen → mode/vendor restore correctly but the **Model spinner snaps back to the first/top entry**. pre2's fix (move spinner listeners to *after* the restore block) did not resolve it.

**Root cause:** `Spinner.setSelection(int)` does **not** invoke `onItemSelected` synchronously — AdapterView defers the selection callback to the next layout pass. So the restore-time `vendorSpinner.setSelection(vSel)` queues a callback that fires *after* the (already-attached) vendor listener is live, runs `rebuildModels(modelSpinner, vIdx, 0)`, and clobbers the just-restored model back to index 0. Listener-attach ordering can't fix an async callback.

**Fix (pre3):** make the vendor listener idempotent. Added field `lastVendorIdx`, set inside `rebuildModels()` to the vendor it just built for. The vendor listener early-returns when `vIdx == lastVendorIdx` (the deferred restore callback → no-op, model preserved); only an actual vendor change (different index) rebuilds the model list with sel=0. Robust regardless of listener-attach timing. Renderer/Vibration unaffected (no cascading model spinner).

**Lesson:** `Spinner.setSelection()` callbacks are asynchronous (next layout) — guarding by listener-attach order is insufficient; guard the listener body on a real value change instead.

### Artifact-only CI
`gh workflow run release.yml --ref fix/per-game-settings-isolation -f version=1.3.0-604-pergame-pre3` (stable defaulted false = artifact-only prerelease). Expect green + 0 SEVERE; deliver alt-AnTuTu APK. Retest: GPU Spoof Spoof-mode → vendor+model → Save → reopen shows the exact card; per-game isolation + in-game apply intact.

## 2026-05-18 — GPU Spoof not applied at launch + customDeviceDesc truncation (pre4)

**Branch:** `fix/per-game-settings-isolation`.

**Symptom (device):** God of War (gameId 49908) set to NVIDIA RTX 4080 via per-game menu, but in-game still reports the real Adreno identity "GameFusion".

**Diagnosis (root-bridge forensics):** per-game store is *correct* — `bh_gpuspoof_prefs.xml` (mtime 22:04 = launch) has `bh_gpuspoof_mode__49908=1`, `device__49908=2704`, `name__49908=NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080`; the new system correctly does NOT write `pc_g_setting49908.xml` (its `bh_gpuspoof_*` keys are orphaned legacy, unsuffixed, mode=0, file mtime 09:24). But the launch-time apply did not fire: `bh_gpuspoof_dxvk.conf` + `GoW_*.log` stale from 05-17, zero `BhGpuSpoof` logcat. Cause: `applyGpuSpoofImpl()` resolved gameId via `sniffGameIdFromStack()` *only*; the `Lbg5;->a` env builder runs before `WineActivity` is in `ActivityThread.mActivities`, so sniff → null → `containerGameId=null` → mode OFF → silent no-op (no conf write). The menu-row click already resolves via `BhMenuGameId.getCaptured()` (→ correct store keying), but the controller's launch path never consulted it.

Secondary bug (from the one prior successful 05-17 GoW_dxgi.log): DXVK's inline `DXVK_CONFIG` value parser splits on whitespace, so `dxgi.customDeviceDesc = NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080` was truncated to `NVIDIA`. IDs (space-free) applied fine.

**Fix (pre4):**
1. **Launch gameId capture.** `applyGpuSpoofImpl()` now resolves `gid = BhMenuGameId.getCaptured()` first, falling back to `sniffGameIdFromStack()` — identical order to `BhGpuSpoofMenuRowClick`. The shared `MenuGameIdCapturePatch` (already a dependency of the GPU Spoof menu row) stashes the id when the user opens the per-game menu, so the launch path now scopes to the right game even though WineActivity isn't yet on the stack.
2. **customDeviceDesc truncation.** Inline `DXVK_CONFIG` env now carries ONLY the space-free numeric IDs (dxgi/d3d9/dxvk customVendorId/customDeviceId). The space-containing `dxgi.customDeviceDesc` is written only into the dxvk.conf file body (file parser handles spaces); `DXVK_CONFIG_FILE` points at it and DXVK keeps the file value since the env no longer overrides that key.

### Artifact-only CI
`gh workflow run release.yml --ref fix/per-game-settings-isolation -f version=1.3.0-604-pergame-pre4` (stable false). Retest: GoW set NVIDIA → launch → in-game GPU reads NVIDIA (not GameFusion); `bh_gpuspoof_dxvk.conf` rewritten at launch with full `customDeviceDesc`; `BhGpuSpoof: GPU spoof active 10de:2704` in logcat; per-game isolation + model-persistence (pre3) intact.

## 2026-05-18 — GPU Spoof: ROOT CAUSE = main↔`:wine` process boundary (pre5)

**Branch:** `fix/per-game-settings-isolation`. Commit `292fba6`. CI run **26072733452** GREEN, 0 SEVERE.

**pre4 device test FAILED — same symptom:** GoW (49908) set NVIDIA RTX 4080, launched 22:23. Forensics: `bh_gpuspoof_prefs.xml`@22:23 CORRECT (`mode__49908=1 device__49908=2704 name__49908=NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080`); `bh_gpuspoof_dxvk.conf` STALE 05-17 18:00 (NOT rewritten at launch); `launchLog49908.txt`@22:23 has NO DXVK_CONFIG/VK_ICD/GAMESCOPE env.

**ROOT CAUSE (decompiled AndroidManifest):** `com.xj.winemu.WineActivity` is declared `android:process=":wine"`. The pre4 fix (`BhMenuGameId.getCaptured()` at launch) **cannot work by construction**: `captureGameId()` fires on menu-open in the MAIN UI process and sets the `static volatile sCapturedGameId`; the env builder `Lbg5;->a` runs inside WineActivity in the **separate `:wine` process** where that static is unset. `getCaptured()`→null, `sniffGameIdFromStack()`→null (pre-registration) ⇒ `containerGameId=null` ⇒ strict-per-game store yields `MODE_OFF` ⇒ early-return BEFORE the unconditional conf write ⇒ stale conf, stock adapter. The disk-backed store crosses processes fine; only the gameId KEY was lost.

**Confirmed against the user's "worked fine" build** (run 26064254882 = branch `test/offline-picker-merge-lite` @ `06fdd05`): that commit does NOT contain the strict-per-game rework; its `reloadSettings()` still reads the **GLOBAL** `bh_gpuspoof_prefs` fallback. So it "worked" by applying the spoof globally at launch — the `:wine` defect existed there too, just masked by the global fallback. Removing that fallback for true per-game isolation (kills app-wide leak + DiRT3 deep-blackscreen) UNMASKED the latent defect. Not a regression; the old design never truly scoped per-game at launch.

**Fix (pre5, `292fba6`):** `BhMenuGameId` now mirrors the captured id to SharedPreferences (`bh_menu_gameid`/`id`, synchronous `.commit()`) on every `captureGameId`, and `getCaptured()` falls back to that disk value (caching into the static) when the in-process static is empty. SharedPreferences cross `:wine` exactly like the per-game store. Extension-only, no patch/anchor change; lint-compiles clean vs android-34. Fixes GPU Spoof + Renderer + Vibration in one shared place (all three share this capture).

**Lesson:** `WineActivity` = `:wine` process. ANY Java static set in the UI/menu process is invisible to launch-time code (`Lbg5;->a` / `applyGpuSpoof`). Cross the process boundary via disk (SharedPreferences/file), never a static.

**Retest (GoW 49908):** set NVIDIA → launch → in-game reads NVIDIA not GameFusion; `bh_gpuspoof_dxvk.conf` mtime updates at the launch; new `shared_prefs/bh_menu_gameid.xml` has `<string name="id">49908</string>` (proves gameId crossed into `:wine`); `BhGpuSpoof: GPU spoof active 10de:2704` logged. **NOT merged** — hold until device-confirmed.

### pre5 ✅ DEVICE-CONFIRMED (2026-05-18 22:44, GoW 49908 → NVIDIA RTX 4090)
Verified chain: `shared_prefs/bh_menu_gameid.xml` = `<string name="id">49908</string>` (gameId crossed the main→`:wine` boundary — the decisive proof the disk-bridge works); `bh_gpuspoof_dxvk.conf` rewritten at launch (mtime 22:44; was stale 05-17 on pre4) with body `10de:2684` + `customDeviceDesc = NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090` (full, untruncated — pre4 secondary fix holds); **in-game GPU reads NVIDIA** (previously GameFusion). No `BhGpuSpoof` logcat line (AnTuTu floods/rolls the buffer) — the fresh conf + in-game identity are hard proof the launch apply fired. Root cause (`:wine` process boundary defeats Java statics) and the SharedPreferences disk-bridge fix are both validated. The shared `BhMenuGameId` bridge also corrects Renderer + Vibration launch-scoping (same boundary).

**NOT merged — pending user go.** On go: `fix/per-game-settings-isolation` → `gamehub-604-build` `--no-ff` (author The412Banner, no Claude trailer) → refresh `feature/lite-variant-tier1` off new 604 → update README + master-map (note the `:wine`-boundary lesson + that it fixes all three per-game features).

## 2026-05-18 — Renderer: SAME `:wine` boundary bug, fixed (pre6)

**Branch:** `fix/per-game-settings-isolation`. Commit pushed; CI run **26073340887** GREEN, 0 SEVERE; renderer/menu-id/gpu-spoof patches all succeeded.

**Device evidence (GoW 49908 left running on Legacy):** `bh_renderer_prefs.xml` correct (`bh_renderer_mode__49908=1`; leftover unsuffixed `bh_renderer_mode=1` = the OLD global that used to mask this), `bh_menu_gameid.xml`=49908, `libxserver_legacy.so`+`libwinemu_legacy.so` present in APK lib dir — yet `/proc/4566/maps` (running `:wine` pid) showed **STOCK** `libxserver.so`+`libwinemu.so`, NOT `_legacy`. Legacy silently no-op'd to stock.

**Root cause = identical to GPU Spoof.** `loadXserver`/`loadWinemu` (replace `System.loadLibrary` in `XServer.<clinit>`, run in the `:wine` process) resolved gameId via `sniffGameIdFromStack()` ONLY → null because the lib swap fires before WineActivity is registered in `:wine`'s mActivities. Pre-rework this was masked by the global fallback (the leftover unsuffixed key); the strict-per-game rework removed the fallback and unmasked it. The earlier PROGRESS/table claim "Renderer sniff works post-WineActivity" was WRONG — disproven by /proc maps.

**Fix (pre6):** new `BhRendererController.launchGameId()` = `BhMenuGameId.getCaptured()` (pre5 SharedPreferences disk-bridge crosses the main↔`:wine` boundary) then `sniffGameIdFromStack()` fallback — identical order to `BhGpuSpoofController.applyGpuSpoofImpl`. All three launch-resolution sites repointed: `isLegacyForLaunchingGame`, `loadXserver`, `loadWinemu`. Imports `BhMenuGameId`; lint-compiles clean vs android-34.

**Corrected rule:** ANY launch/clinit-time per-game resolver running in the `:wine` process MUST use `BhMenuGameId.getCaptured()` first (disk-bridge), never sniff-only. Sniff-only is safe ONLY for genuinely mid-gameplay hooks (e.g. Vibration's rumble-dispatch).

**Retest:** GoW set Legacy → launch → leave running → `/proc/<:wine pid>/maps` must show `libxserver_legacy.so`+`libwinemu_legacy.so` (NOT stock); a game NOT set Legacy stays stock (no leak). **Vibration still needs its own device check** (per-game rumble; sniff-at-rumble-time probably OK but verify, don't assume). GPU Spoof pre5 already device-confirmed. **NOT merged** — hold until renderer + vibration device-confirmed.

### pre6 RENDERER ✅ DEVICE-CONFIRMED (2026-05-18 23:07, GoW 49908 Legacy, running)
Live `:wine` process (pid 17125) `/proc/17125/maps`: `libxserver_legacy.so` + `libwinemu_legacy.so` loaded, **NO stock `libxserver.so`/`libwinemu.so` mapped** (pure 6.0.2 legacy pair); wineserver + full wine guest tree alive → sustained, not crashing. pre6 `launchGameId()` (getCaptured disk-bridge → sniff) correctly resolves gameId 49908 in `:wine` at `XServer.<clinit>`; `isLegacyForGame(49908)`→true. The `:wine` boundary defect is fixed for Renderer exactly as for GPU Spoof.

**Confirmed status:** GPU Spoof (pre5) ✅ + Renderer (pre6) ✅ device-confirmed. **Vibration** still needs its own device check (per-game rumble) — sniff-at-rumble-time is expected OK but unverified; do not assume. **NOT merged** — hold until Vibration device-confirmed, then: `fix/per-game-settings-isolation` → `gamehub-604-build` `--no-ff` (The412Banner, no Claude trailer) → refresh `feature/lite-variant-tier1` → README/master-map.

## 2026-05-18 — Vibration durable breadcrumb (pre7)

**Branch:** `fix/per-game-settings-isolation`. CI run **26073891283** GREEN, 0 SEVERE; vibration/renderer/gpu-spoof/menu-id patches all succeeded.

**Why:** Vibration has no forensic fingerprint — no per-launch file, no distinct lib, and the AnTuTu logcat flood rolls the `Log.i` markers before they can be read. So unlike GPU Spoof (`dxvk.conf`) and Renderer (`_legacy.so` in `/proc/maps`), there was no on-disk way to prove the rumble-dispatch path resolved the correct per-game scope. (The store itself was verified correct & strict: `bh_vibration_{mode,intensity}__<gid>`; leftover unsuffixed `mode/intensity` = dead old global, not read.)

**pre7 (`feat(vibration)`):** `BhVibrationController.breadcrumb()` appends two one-shot lines per process to `<filesDir>/bh_vibration.log`:
- `RESOLVE gid=<g> mode=<m> intensity=<i>` — at `maybeResolveContainerFromActivityStack` container resolve
- `RUMBLE#1 gid=<g> mode=<m> intensity=<i> low=<l> high=<h>` — at first `handleRumble`

Append-only, `appContext`-guarded, never throws; gated by static volatile `sBcResolved`/`sBcRumble`. Production-safe observability (not the stripped diag harness). Lint-clean vs android-34.

### Delivered

**Verify on pre7:** set per-game vibration on the game to be launched (e.g. GoW 49908 mode=1 int=100) AND a *different* value on another game → launch → trigger controller rumble in-game → read `bh_vibration.log`. RESOLVE/RUMBLE#1 `gid` must equal the launched game and `mode`/`intensity` must equal *that game's* per-game value (proves dispatch scoped correctly + no app-wide leak).

**Confirmed:** GPU Spoof (pre5) ✅ + Renderer (pre6) ✅ device-confirmed. Vibration store correct; dispatch awaiting pre7 breadcrumb read. **NOT merged** — hold until Vibration confirmed, then merge `fix/per-game-settings-isolation` → `gamehub-604-build` `--no-ff` → refresh `feature/lite-variant-tier1` → README/master-map.

## 2026-05-18 — Vibration ~2s-cutoff investigation: durable keepalive/guest trace (pre8)

**Branch:** `fix/per-game-settings-isolation`. CI run **26074175298** GREEN, 0 SEVERE; vibration/menu-id patches succeeded.

**Question:** user testing with GameConTest.exe — rumble stops ~2 s. **Verified by code:** rumble is engineered continuous — `CONTROLLER_RUMBLE_MS=2000` effect re-armed by `RUMBLE_KEEPALIVE_MS=1500` keepalive (runnable 60 ms tick) → must outlast 2 s while the guest holds a non-zero amplitude. A clean ~2 s stop ⇒ exactly one of: (a) guest itself sends (0,0) ~1 s after non-zero = SDL/winebus auto-expiry (keepalive map cleared by the (0,0), correctly no re-arm) → fix is guest-side (winebus duration patch / evshim keepalive); or (b) guest stays non-zero but keepalive isn't re-firing host-side. `DEFAULT_MODE=MODE_CONTROLLER`; keepalive map populated only for CONTROLLER/BOTH via `recordKeepalive`.

**pre8 (`feat(vibration)`):** two capped (`BC_TRACE_CAP=40`) channels appended to `<filesDir>/bh_vibration.log`, independent of the DIAG-stripped `logGuestTransition`:
- `GUEST slot=<s> <pl>,<ph> -> <nl>,<nh> gap=<ms>` — each real XInput transition; flags non-zero→(0,0) in 800–1300 ms as `[SDL_AUTO_EXPIRY?]`
- `KEEPALIVE dev=<id> low=<l> high=<h> mode=<m>` — each controller re-arm fire
Append-only, `appContext`-guarded, never throws; counters cap so the file can't grow unbounded.

**Read on pre8 after the cutoff:** `GUEST` non-zero→(0,0) gap≈1000 ms `[SDL_AUTO_EXPIRY?]` ⇒ guest-side stop (winebus/SDL); `GUEST` stays non-zero + sparse/no `KEEPALIVE` ⇒ host keepalive not firing. Also doubles as the Vibration per-game scope proof (RESOLVE/RUMBLE#1 gid + mode/intensity). GameConTest input mode (held slider vs timed test button) must be noted. **Confirmed:** GPU Spoof (pre5) ✅ + Renderer (pre6) ✅. Vibration scope + 2 s behavior pending pre8 read. **NOT merged.**

## 2026-05-18 — Vibration: two bugs found from pre8 trace; per-game scope fixed (pre9)

**Branch:** `fix/per-game-settings-isolation`. CI run **26074438727** GREEN, 0 SEVERE; vibration/menu-id patches succeeded.

**pre8 `bh_vibration.log` (GameConTest.exe, 23:27):** `RUMBLE#1 gid=(global) mode=1 intensity=100`, **NO RESOLVE line**, repeated `GUEST slot=0 65535,0 -> 0,0 gap≈1000ms [SDL_AUTO_EXPIRY?]`, **ZERO KEEPALIVE lines**.

**Bug 1 — per-game scope broken (same `:wine` defect, 3rd feature):** no RESOLVE + `gid=(global)` ⇒ `maybeResolveContainerFromActivityStack()` never resolved (sniff null in `:wine`); vibration ran on strict defaults (`DEFAULT_MODE=MODE_CONTROLLER=1`, `DEFAULT_INTENSITY=100`), NOT the per-game 49908 value (values coincide but unscoped — an Off-set game would still rumble). The earlier "vibration resolves at rumble-time post-WineActivity" reasoning was wrong — device disproved it (same as the renderer surprise). **Fixed (pre9):** `maybeResolveContainerFromActivityStack()` now prefers `BhMenuGameId.getCaptured()` (pre5 SharedPreferences disk-bridge) before the stack sniff; imports `BhMenuGameId`; emits `RESOLVE … src=menuid`. Identical fix to GPU Spoof pre5 / Renderer pre6. Lint-clean. **Final rule: every per-game resolver runs in `:wine` where sniff is null — all three needed the disk-bridge; no `:wine`-side sniff-only path is ever safe.**

**Bug 2 — ~2 s cutoff = guest-side SDL/winebus ~1 s auto-expiry, NOT host keepalive:** GUEST trace shows the guest itself sending `(0,0)` ~1000 ms after each non-zero; zero KEEPALIVE is *correct* (`recordKeepalive(…,0,0)` clears the entry when the guest zeroes, so the host rightly doesn't re-arm — re-arming would rumble during intended silence). Host keepalive cannot fix this; the stop originates in Wine ⇒ the preload-free `winebus.so` duration patch is not effective in this Proton10-arm64x GoW (49908) container. **PARKED by user** — separate track, revisit after the per-game work is merged. Not a host-side change.

**Verify on pre9:** set GoW 49908 vibration to **Off (mode 0)** (distinct from default MODE_CONTROLLER) → launch → trigger rumble. Pass = `bh_vibration.log` has `RESOLVE gid=49908 src=menuid` AND no rumble (per-game scope actually applied, not coincidental defaults). The ~1 s stutter (Bug 2) will still be present — parked, ignore.

**Confirmed:** GPU Spoof (pre5) ✅ + Renderer (pre6) ✅. Vibration per-game scope pending pre9 re-read. **NOT merged** — hold until Vibration scope confirmed, then merge `fix/per-game-settings-isolation` → `gamehub-604-build` `--no-ff` → refresh `feature/lite-variant-tier1` → README/master-map; Bug 2 stays a parked separate track.

## 2026-05-19 — Vibration scope pre9 DEVICE-CONFIRMED; Bug 2 read-only inspection (root cause corrected); pre10 winebus breadcrumbs

**Branch:** `fix/per-game-settings-isolation`. CI run **26075313929** (pre10), artifact-only (stable=false).

### pre9 device read — Vibration per-game scope ✅ CONFIRMED
`bh_vibration.log` (GoW 49908, 2026-05-18 23:37):
```
2026-05-18 23:37:08 RESOLVE gid=49908 src=menuid mode=1 intensity=100
2026-05-18 23:37:08 RUMBLE#1 gid=49908 mode=1 intensity=100 low=2048 high=2048
```
vs pre8 (23:27): `RUMBLE#1 gid=(global)`, no RESOLVE. The pre5 disk-bridge resolve fired in `:wine`; per-game vibration scope works. **All three per-game features now device-confirmed: GPU Spoof pre5 ✅ · Renderer pre6 ✅ · Vibration pre9 ✅.** Branch is at the merge gate — **HELD pending user merge-go** (user explicitly said no merge yet).

### Bug 2 — read-only winebus inspection (user-authorized); earlier hypothesis DISPROVEN
Replicated `patchWinebusDurationFile()` checks read-only on the live container via the root bridge. The arm64x winebus.so GoW 49908 uses — `…/files/usr/opt/wine_proton10.0-arm64x-2/arm64-v8a/lib/wine/aarch64-unix/winebus.so` (the only arm64 winebus in the 53,279-file tree):

| Gate | Value | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| ELF / `e_machine` | `0xb7` AARCH64 | aarch64 patch path |
| "SDL_JoystickRumble" | present (×4) | passes pre-gate |
| ORIGINAL `a3c35eb8 00013fd6` | **exactly 2** | **pattern matches perfectly** |
| PATCHED `03008012 00013fd6` | **0** | file unpatched |
| depth / files / skip-dir | 8 / 53279 / none | < 16 / < 100k / not skipped |
| mtime | 04:51 (= proton-extract) | never rewritten at 23:37 launch |

`patchAarch64Sites()` with `originalCount==2, patchedCount==0` would **succeed** — the aarch64 byte-pattern is correct for Proton10-arm64x. The old note ("pattern not effective on Proton10-arm64x") is **wrong**. Both winebus.so (arm64x + x64) retain extraction mtimes with 0 patched sites ⇒ **`ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce()` never executes its write**. Hook 4's `invoke-static` at the `Lbg5;->a` env-builder anchor either isn't firing in the 6.0.4 base or throws and is swallowed by the method's `catch(Throwable)`→`Log.w` (rolled out of AnTuTu logcat). **⇒ Bug 2 IS host-side-fixable** — the disk-patcher is simply a no-op; not a guest-side dead end as previously parked. Same *family* as the `:wine`-boundary bugs (env builder runs in `:wine`) but a DISTINCT bug.

### pre10 — durable WINEBUS breadcrumbs (commit 848ba1f)
Added static `bcWinebus(ctx, …)` (mirrors instance `breadcrumb`) → `<filesDir>/bh_vibration.log`, prefixed `WINEBUS`, at every patcher decision point: hook-fired (ctx + pid), scan guard outcomes, scan summary (root/files/winebus/patched/already/ms), per-file elf/rumble/machine, aarch64+x86_64 original/patched counts + APPLIED/MISMATCH/ALREADY-PATCHED. Log-only, zero patch-behaviour change; `patchAarch64Sites`/`patchX86_64Sites` gained an internal `Context` param (both call sites updated). Brace-balanced, 16 breadcrumb calls.

### MORNING CONTINUATION — exactly where we left off
1. **Install** the delivered pre10 full alt-AnTuTu APK (pkg `com.antutu.benchmark.full`).
2. **Launch GoW 49908** (any vibration setting). Then read `bh_vibration.log` and grep `WINEBUS`:
   - **No `WINEBUS hook fired` line** ⇒ Hook 4's `invoke-static` at `Lbg5;->a` is not executing → re-anchor the patch (R8 map drift / wrong join-setup index / `:wine` proc).
   - `hook fired` present but **no `scan` line** / `scan EXCEPTION` ⇒ ctx issue or thrown+swallowed.
   - `scan … winebus=0` ⇒ scan ran but didn't reach the file (tree-root / listFiles perms / timing vs extraction).
   - `aarch64 MISMATCH` ⇒ (won't happen — inspection proved match, but covered).
   - `aarch64 APPLIED original=2 …` then **still** ~1 s cutoff ⇒ patch wrote but a *different* winebus.so is loaded at runtime (check live `:wine` `/proc/<pid>/maps`).
3. Fix whichever branch the breadcrumb pinpoints (most likely: re-anchor Hook 4). Keep Bug 2 a separate track from the per-game merge.
4. **Per-game merge still HELD** awaiting explicit user go: `fix/per-game-settings-isolation` → `gamehub-604-build` `--no-ff` (author The412Banner, no Claude trailer) → refresh `feature/lite-variant-tier1` → README/PROGRESS_LOG/master-map.

### Delivered
CI run **26075313929** GREEN, **0 SEVERE**; "PC-accurate vibration" + "Per-game menu id capture (shared)" + GPU Spoof/Renderer/Vibration patches all `succeeded` on alt-AnTuTu (artifact-only, stable=false).
`/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-604-pergame-pre10-Patched-alt-AnTuTu.apk` (116,070,822 B, md5 `3547fe9d7ace930562a74fce84519b07`). Full pkg `com.antutu.benchmark.full` (installs alongside `banner.hub` Lite).

### pre10 DEVICE READ (2026-05-19 04:51, GoW 49908) — Hook 4 DEAD-CODE injection found
Installed APK md5 `3547fe9d…` = pre10 confirmed (`/data/app/.../base.apk`). `bh_vibration.log` 04:51:24 block has `RESOLVE gid=49908 src=menuid` + `RUMBLE#1 gid=49908` (controller breadcrumbs fire; pre9 per-game scope re-confirmed) but **`grep -c WINEBUS` = 0** — not even the entry breadcrumb.
Decompiled the delivered pre10 APK (`apktool d -r`): the injected pair landed in `smali_classes5/bg5.smali`, the sole `a(Leco;Ljava/lang/String;Z)V` `.locals 35` env builder (correct method) — but **immediately after an unconditional `goto :goto_4` and before a `:cond_9` label, with no label of its own** ⇒ unreachable dead code ⇒ `ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce` never called. Root cause = the fragile `setupStartIdx = joinIdx - 5` anchor: in the 6.0.4 base (versionCode 114) `joinIdx - 5` falls inside the ArrayList-building loop, not the `:`-separator arg-setup block. Not a pattern miss, not an R8 letter shift — purely a wrong relative offset. Resolves the prior "patcher never executes" hypothesis with proof.

### pre11 — Hook 4 re-anchored to method entry (index 0)
Dropped the `joinIdx - 5` arithmetic and the now-dead join-helper machinery (`indexOfFirstInstructionOrThrow`/`getReference`/`Opcode`/`MethodReference` imports, `JOIN_HELPER`/`JOIN_METHOD`/`JOIN_LAMBDA` consts + doc). Hook 4 now injects at **index 0** of `Lbg5;->a` — unconditionally reached every launch, same guaranteed spot Hooks 1–3 use:
```
move-object/from16 v0, p0
iget-object v0, v0, Lbg5;->a:Landroid/content/Context;
invoke-static {v0}, Lcom/xj/winemu/vibration/BhVibrationController;->ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce(Landroid/content/Context;)V
```
`p0`=this (high reg under `.locals 35`); v0 clobbered but the method's own first instr `move-object/from16 v0, p0` re-inits it immediately. `ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce` is AtomicBoolean-gated so an at-entry call is correct + self-deduplicating. No labels added (trailing-label footgun N/A at index 0). 1 file, +23/−37.

### MORNING CONTINUATION (updated)
1. Install pre11 full alt-AnTuTu APK; launch GoW 49908.
2. `grep WINEBUS bh_vibration.log` — now the entry/scan/per-file/aarch64 breadcrumbs MUST appear. Then follow the same branch table as pre10 (expect `aarch64 APPLIED original=2`; if so and rumble still cuts, check live `:wine` `/proc/<pid>/maps` for which winebus.so is mapped).
3. Per-game merge still HELD awaiting explicit user go (unchanged).

## 2026-05-19 — 🚀 v1.4.0-604 STABLE SHIPPED

### pre11 DEVICE-CONFIRMED + Bug 2 cured
pre11 (Hook 4 re-anchored to `Lbg5;->a` index 0) device-confirmed 05:05 (GoW 49908): `bh_vibration.log` shows `WINEBUS hook fired`, `x86_64 APPLIED original=2`, `aarch64 APPLIED original=2`, `scan patched=2`; later `:wine` procs report `ALREADY-PATCHED` (disk patch persists + survives the main↔`:wine` boundary). Bug 2 (~2 s rumble cutoff) **cured** — GameConTest.exe 05:14 run: heavy motor held ~5 s, light motor ~7 s, **zero `[SDL_AUTO_EXPIRY?]` flags** (vs the unpatched `gap≈1000ms` signature), KEEPALIVE lines now present. User confirmed "longer than 2 seconds."

### Merge + stable cut
- `fix/per-game-settings-isolation` → `gamehub-604-build` `--no-ff` merge `0dcd910` (19 commits `3d85d45`→`1bb5156`; author The412Banner, no Claude trailer). Lite refreshed via `--no-ff` `c3f4619`; 4 strips verified intact.
- README stale vibration-storage paragraph corrected (`7add007`); v1.4.0-604 release notes + README What's-new authored (`6800fdc`): GPU Spoof / Legacy renderer / strict per-game store / rumble-cutoff fix, `release.yml` "On top of" bumped v1.2.0→v1.3.0 (was stale), version literal parameterized.
- Stable cut: `release.yml` dispatch `--ref gamehub-604-build -f version=1.4.0-604 -f stable=true` → run [`26089552265`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26089552265) **0 SEVERE**, cert SHA-256 `10895a311fe04f95f82e4da5c9a6c041ba9282bf211f1b578fe1cbeb894ce0ba` **unchanged** (in-place updates intact). Lite artifact-only run [`26089555381`](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26089555381) **0 SEVERE**, 9 Lite APKs `gh release upload`ed.
- **21 release assets**: 9 full `BannerHub-V6-1.4.0-604-Patched-*.apk` + 9 `…-Lite.apk` + 3 `.rvp`. Release live, not draft/prerelease.

### Offline component picker omission — corrected
The Offline component picker (merged `dbd7554` 2026-05-18, ancestor of the v1.4.0-604 tag `6800fdc`) was missing from the initial v1.4.0 What's-new (drafted scoped to per-game work). Added on all three surfaces: live release notes (`gh release edit`), `release.yml` template + README subsection (`9574522`), re-synced to Lite (`b689a1a`). README headline "Four"→"Five".

### Final branch state
`gamehub-604-build` @ `9574522`; `feature/lite-variant-tier1` @ `b689a1a`. Pre-release policy resumes — all builds artifact-only until user says "stable" again.

## 2026-05-19 — Release notes: "separate projects / use at your own risk" warning added

User noticed the live `v1.4.0-604` release description did **not** carry the README's `⚠️ Important — please read before installing` block (README.md:33–45: BannerHub v6 ≠ 3.7.x ≠ Lite, separate package/keystore/backend, no in-place cross-update, WIP / barely tested, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK). Verified absent via grep of the live body (zero matches for `own risk` / `SEPARATE projects` / `read before installing` / etc.); confirmed present only in README.

Fix on both surfaces:
- **Live `v1.4.0-604` notes** — block spliced verbatim directly under the `## BannerHub v6 1.4.0-604` header (before "A patched build of…") via `gh release edit --notes-file`; re-verified present (lines 3/5/15).
- **Going-forward template** — same blockquote inserted into `release.yml`'s slim `body: |` block right after the version header, so every future v6 stable emits it automatically. Commit `27d98d4` on `gamehub-604-build` (`4c5ad1a..27d98d4`, 1 file +14), authored The412Banner / the412banner@users.noreply.github.com, no Claude trailer, pushed. No CI trigger (notes-template-only edit).

Branch head: `gamehub-604-build` @ `27d98d4`. (Not added to `gamehub_reports/GAMEHUB_600_MASTER_MAP.md` — that map documents upstream GameHub 6.0 internals, not BannerHub release/doc changes.)

## 2026-05-19 — GOG integration Phase 1 WS1: M1+M2 device-confirmed

`feature/gog-explore-tab`. Ported BannerHub-3.7.x GOG Java extension (19 GOG-only files, decoupled from store-entangled Epic/Amazon shared infra) → `extensions/gamehub/.../gamehub/gog/`; `GogLaunchHelper` Phase-1 stub; `GogManifestPatch.kt` registers 6 activities (`GogMainActivity` exported = temp adb dev entry). Compile gate (run 26111173073) + 9-APK artifact build `1.4.0-604-gog-pre1` (run 26111421796, artifact-only) both green first attempt, no fixes. Device test on Normal-GHL/`gamehub.lite`: **M1 login PASS** (full GOG OAuth, `bh_gog_prefs` → access/refresh token + `username=The412Banner`), **M2 owned-library PASS** (20 GOG game IDs cached from `embed.gog.com/user/data/games`), 0 crashes. Zero code fixes through compile→build→M1→M2. Remaining Phase 1: M3 (download+install). Phase 2 deferred (bridge §19 / Profile-row WS4-P-A / P-C). Full trace: `gamehub_reports/GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md` §1–§24. Pre-release: artifact-only.

## 2026-05-19 — GOG Phase 1 COMPLETE (M1+M2+M3 device-confirmed)

`feature/gog-explore-tab`. pre2 `1.4.0-604-gog-pre2` (run 26112532244) fixed the §25 missing-`<service>` bug (BhDownloadService unregistered → downloads couldn't start). Device retest on Normal-GHL/`gamehub.lite`: M3 PASS — GunSlugs (GOG 1709371377) downloaded+installed via in-app UI to `/data/user/0/gamehub.lite/files/gog_games/Gunslugs/` (86 MB, 580 files, gunslugs.exe + .dat + GOG hashdb/manifest + jre/), prefs `gog_dir`/`gog_exe` set = INSTALLED. **All Phase 1 done** (M1 login + M2 owned-library + M3 download); one bug total (§25) across the whole port. Phase 2 (bridge §19 / Profile-row WS4-P-A / P-C) deferred. Trace: GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md §1–§26.

## 2026-05-19 — GOG WS4 pre4 VerifyError root-caused → pre5 (verifier-safe non-suspend anchor)

`feature/gog-explore-tab`. pre4 device (`gamehub.lite`, logcat 14:27:54): tapping the seeded GOG card **crashed** — `java.lang.VerifyError: Verifier rejected class wel` (`wel.b [0x0] copyRes1 v0 <- result0 type=Undefined`). Root cause: pre4 hook (2) anchored on the **Kotlin `suspend`** strategy resolver `wel.b(Lwel;Lw4c;Lci3;)` and prepended at index 0; the coroutine state-machine dispatch at the suspend head makes the splice reachable without our invoke → class rejected → instant crash. Suspend-fn sibling of the index-0 trailing-label footgun; **rule: never index-0-prepend a Kotlin suspend method** (all of `wel.b`/`wel.a`/`vl7.l`/`po7.G` are suspend). **pre5 (Option 1 — hook the non-suspend caller):** decompile trace → tap dispatched via `vl7.l` K/A/B into the two non-suspend launch orchestrators `po7.F0(GameInfo)V` (full, refs `GameInfo.getHasAchievements`) and `po7.G0(GameInfo)V` (lean, no it). Hook (2) rewritten: two **letter-free** structural fingerprints (kept-name `LaunchType`/`GameInfo.getSteamAppId` + getHasAchievements presence/absence), guard **both** with the verifier-safe non-suspend pattern (`invoke-static {p1} maybeOpenHubFromLaunchCtx; if-eqz :bhOrig; return-void`). Extension **unchanged** — existing `maybeOpenHubFromLaunchCtx` already extracts the id from a `GameInfo` arg (`deepExtractId`→`getId()`). Seeder still CONFIRMED working. Files: `GogLibraryCardPatch.kt` (+126/−50), `GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md` §31. Next: compile gate → pre5 artifact → device (tap → GOG hub, no crash?).

## 2026-05-19 — GOG WS4 pre5 silent no-apply → pre6 (idiom fix + try/catch graceful-degrade)

`feature/gog-explore-tab`. pre5 (run 26118758523, commit `7262151`) built green and the Normal-GHL APK was delivered, but `gh run --log` audit caught `SEVERE: "GOG library card (permanent)" failed: PatchException: Collection is empty.` on **all 9 variants** — F0/G0 `firstMethod` matched nothing and (a `firstMethod` miss throws) the **whole GOG patch silently no-applied**: no card at all, strictly worse than pre4's crash (the playbook's CI-doesn't-fail-on-SEVERE silent-ship footgun; caught only because we explicitly grepped the patch log per [[feedback_always_verify_never_assume]]). Smali re-verified the fingerprint *content* was correct (F0 po7:21832 / G0 po7:23114 carry the exact getSteamAppId/LaunchType/getHasAchievements refs; other shipped patches prove `parameterTypes` excludes implicit `this`). Suspected cause: pre5 routed the scans through a **local `bodyRefs` helper called inside `firstMethod {}`**, unlike every working anchor (hook 1/pre3/pre4) which inlines `implementation?.instructions?.any{}==true` with opcode guards. **pre6:** inline the proven opcode-guarded idiom (no helper in predicate); `parameterTypes == listOf(gameInfoT)` (proven seed-hook form); direct `firstMethod→getInstruction(0)→addInstructionsWithLabels` (= pre4 sequence, no reflection); **each anchor in its own try/catch** so a future miss degrades to "card still appears" (§22) instead of nuking the patch — silent-ship footgun structurally neutralised. Files: `GogLibraryCardPatch.kt`, `GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md` §31. Next: compile gate → pre6 artifact (audit patch log for SEVERE before delivering) → device.

## 2026-05-19 — GOG WS4 pre6 device → real launch path found → pre7 (yv3.invoke intercept)

`feature/gog-explore-tab`. pre6 (run 26119508288, `eed0c8a`) **applied cleanly — 0 SEVERE on the GOG patch, all 9 variants** (pre5 footgun confirmed fixed; gated delivery worked). Device (Normal-GHL/`gamehub.lite`): card + seeder **CONFIRMED** (GOG card renders; tap → game-detail dialog; **no crash** — pre4 VerifyError gone). But "Launch Game" → `No strategy found: type=Unknown, methodId=4`. `getlog` decisive: launch is GameHub's **LaunchRouter interceptor chain** (`buildLibraryInfoWithContext GOG, startType=0` → `typeFilteredStrategies type=Unknown` empty → `wel` order=1000 fails → chain o3h…nga → `LaunchRouter.launch result=t5c`), **zero `GogLibraryCard` log lines** = our F0/G0 guard never ran. Root cause: the card-tap→dialog→"Launch Game" path does **not** go through `po7.F0/G0` at all (wrong launch surface); pre6's try/catch correctly degraded (card works) but masked the wrong-path non-match. **pre7:** re-anchor on the first non-suspend point holding the game — the multiplexed Function0 lambda `yv3.invoke()Ljava/lang/Object;` (`smali_classes4/yv3.smali`; NOT a coroutine → index-0 verifier-safe, unlike §31 `wel.b`), fingerprinted by the stable non-obf CONST_STRING `"buildLibraryInfoWithContext "` (pre4-proven match style) + no-arg `invoke()Object` shape. Inject ONE side-effect-only `invoke-static {p0}, GogLibraryCard;->openHubIfSentinel(Ljava/lang/Object;)V` at index 0 (no move-result/branch/return/clobber — minimal verifier-safe edit). New extension `openHubIfSentinel`/`findSentinel`: bounded (depth≤3), identity-cycle-guarded, fail-safe reflective walk lambda→`t07`→`GameInfo`, exact `getId()==bh_gog_launcher`, opens GogMainActivity (4 s dedupe); original launch proceeds & harmlessly fails behind the foregrounded hub → no abort logic, **real game launches byte-for-byte unaffected**. Files: `GogLibraryCard.java`, `GogLibraryCardPatch.kt`, `GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md` §32. Next: compile gate → **grep GOG SEVERE before delivering** → pre7 artifact → device (Launch Game → GOG hub; real games still launch?).

## 2026-05-19 — GOG WS4 pre7 device → intercept WORKS; pre8 (main-thread gate fixes premature auto-open)

`feature/gog-explore-tab`. pre7 (run 26120382093, `8657a9b`, **0 SEVERE — gated**) device: **intercept CONFIRMED working** — manual path (back → library → tap GOG card → Launch Game) **opens the GOG sign-in / library**. yv3.invoke anchor + reflective sentinel walk + GogMainActivity = correct. **Bug:** also auto-opens immediately on app start (before any tap). §32 logcat pins it by **TID**: `buildLibraryInfoWithContext GOG` runs for the sentinel both at library precompute (**bg thread** `20830/20894`, ~3 s pre-tap) and on the user Launch press (**main thread** `20830/20830`). yv3.invoke is multiplexed and that case runs in both contexts → case/selector scoping can't separate them; the **thread** does (robust, non-obfuscated, no smali fragility). **pre8 (extension-only):** first line of `openHubIfSentinel` → `if (Looper.myLooper() != Looper.getMainLooper()) return;` — suppresses the bg startup auto-open, keeps the main-thread Launch press. Card-tap→dialog logs no buildLibraryInfoWithContext (only bg-startup + main-launch), so dialog opens normally; hub fires only on real Launch. Head injection/fingerprint/seed-hook unchanged. Files: `GogLibraryCard.java` (+main-thread guard), `GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md` §32a. Next: compile gate → grep GOG SEVERE → pre8 → device (no auto-open on start; Launch → hub; real games unaffected).

## 2026-05-19 — GOG WS4 pre8 device → FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE; pre9 (orientation polish)

`feature/gog-explore-tab`. pre8 (run 26121495276, `b01d286`, **0 SEVERE — gated**) device (Normal-GHL/`gamehub.lite`): **all 3 pass** — (1) no auto-open on app start (main-thread gate works), (2) GOG card → Launch Game → GOG sign-in/library opens, (3) real games unaffected. **WS4 (permanent GOG card → tap → GOG hub) is functionally complete** — seeder + yv3.invoke intercept + reflective sentinel walk + 4 s dedupe + main-thread gate all device-confirmed; launch-router fallthrough fails harmlessly behind the hub. Full iteration trail: pre3 wrong anchor → pre4 suspend VerifyError → pre5 silent no-apply → pre6 idiom fix → pre7 yv3 → pre8 thread-gate. **Sole remaining nit → pre9:** GOG activities open **portrait** while GameHub runs **landscape** — `GogManifestPatch` registered them with theme+configChanges but no `android:screenOrientation` (→ unspecified → portrait). GameHub locks content screens to `sensorLandscape` (sub-screens use `behind` to inherit, but the hub is NEW_TASK-launched from app context so `behind` → portrait fallback). pre9 (manifest-only, zero bytecode risk): add `android:screenOrientation="sensorLandscape"` to all 6 GOG activities. Files: `GogManifestPatch.kt`, `GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md` §32b + status header. Next: compile gate → grep GOG SEVERE → pre9 → device (GOG flow opens landscape, matching the app).

## 2026-05-19 — GOG explore-mode = expensive surface → PIVOT to menu-row entry (pre10)

`feature/gog-explore-tab`. User report: in GameHub **explore mode** (portrait) the seeded GOG card doesn't show under any menus (handheld/landscape works fully, device-confirmed pre8). Explore-mode logcat probe (`…163030`): seeder ran but **zero** `buildLibraryInfoWithContext`/library activity for our row → explore is a **separate library surface** that never queries the local sentinel. Making the card appear there = the `s6d`/`wrc` dual-enum + Compose-grid surgery the design doc flags as highest-risk (the path the card approach avoided; structurally mode-bound). **User decision: pivot to the menu-row entry** (design doc §16/§300 production recommendation). **pre10:** added `BhGogMenuRowClick.java` (trimmed clone of `BhGpuSpoofMenuRowClick`, Menu A only: `appendGogRowTo` builds `Liae(icon,"GOG",Proxy<pw6> click)`; click → `resolveTopActivity` → `startActivity(GogMainActivity)`) + `GogMenuRowPatch.kt` (clone of GpuSpoof **Injection 1 only**: fingerprint `Lx57;->a(Lf37;Lpo7;Lv83;I)V`, inject `invoke-static {v4} appendGogRowTo` after last `Lx9d;->add`; no `dependsOn` — raw String label, no resolver). The per-game More Menu exists in BOTH modes → mode-independent. Seeded card + yv3 intercept **kept** (handheld 2nd entry, harmless). pre9 `sensorLandscape` **reverted** (§32c) — user uses explore/portrait too; back to `unspecified` so GOG screens follow the current mode. Library-tile popups (ted.f/pzc.j0) deferred. Risk: menu-injection is iterate-prone (pre7→pre17 historically) but cloning a device-confirmed injection 1:1, simplest menu first. Files: `BhGogMenuRowClick.java`, `GogMenuRowPatch.kt`, `GogManifestPatch.kt`, `GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md` §33 + status header. Next: compile gate → **grep SEVERE for BOTH `GOG menu row` + `GOG library card`** → pre10 → device (any game → More Menu → "GOG" → GogMainActivity, both modes).

## 2026-05-19 — GOG menu row pre10 CONFIRMED → pre11 (all 3 per-game menus)

`feature/gog-explore-tab`. pre10 (run 26124180311, `7418f47`, 0 SEVERE — gated) device: **"GOG" More-Menu row works**, opens GogMainActivity. User wants it in the other per-game menu locations too (same set as Renderer/GPU Spoof/Vibration = 3 menus). **pre11:** promoted `GogMenuRowPatch` from Injection-1-only to a **full 1:1 clone of GpuSpoofMenuRowPatch** — added Injection 2 (library-tile popup `ted.f`, 7-arg, `Lscd` row via `Lqs2;->H`, raw String label) + Injection 3 (library-list popup `Lpzc;->j0`, `Lz4e(Lell,Lnw6,int)` row, `Lell` Unsafe-allocated key `string:bh_gog_label`). Added `"string:bh_gog_label"→"GOG"` to the shared `BhMenuRowClick.maybeResolveCustomLabel` (the single `Lxd3;->l1` head-block owned by vibrationMenuRowPatch); `GogMenuRowPatch` now `dependsOn(vibrationMenuRowPatch)` — **no 2nd l1 block** (stacked ANR, playbook 2026-05-17). Extension gained `appendScdRowToTedList`/`appendLibraryPopupRow`/`newFunction0Proxy`/`safeReturn`. All 3 injections byte-identical to shipped GpuSpoof (only helper names + sentinel key differ) → low risk. Files: `GogMenuRowPatch.kt`, `BhGogMenuRowClick.java`, `BhMenuRowClick.java` (vibration, +GOG key), `GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md` §33a. Next: compile gate → grep SEVERE (`GOG menu row` + `GOG library card`) → pre11 → device (any game → both popup menus + More Menu show "GOG" → GogMainActivity, both modes).

## 2026-05-19 — GOG pre12: retire seeded card + auto-rotate GOG screens (§34)

`feature/gog-explore-tab`. pre11 device-confirmed "GOG" row in all 3 per-game menus. User asks: (a) remove the now-redundant library card, (b) GOG screens auto-rotate to fit handheld/explore. **pre12:** (a) `gogLibraryCardPatch` repurposed — proven `MainActivity.onCreate` anchor now calls **`ensureRemoved`** (guarded idempotent DELETE of `bh_gog_launcher` rows from `t_game_library_base`/`t_game_launch_method`) instead of `ensureSeeded`, so the card vanishes on existing seeding-build installs too; **old hook 2 (yv3.invoke launch-intercept) deleted entirely** (only served the card; menu row uses `BhGogMenuRowClick` directly) — net −1 bytecode injection, no more reflective launch-router walk. Patch name kept stable; `ensureSeeded` left dead/harmless. (b) `GogManifestPatch` orientation pre9 `sensorLandscape`→pre10 `unspecified`→**pre12 `fullSensor`** on all 6 GOG activities (free 4-way sensor rotation, ignores OS rotate-lock so it reliably matches how the device is held per mode; `configChanges` already prevents recreate). Menu-row patch + extension unchanged. Files: `GogLibraryCardPatch.kt`, `GogLibraryCard.java` (+ensureRemoved), `GogManifestPatch.kt`, `GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md` §34 + status header. Next: compile gate → grep SEVERE (`GOG menu row` + `GOG library card`) → pre12 → device (no card in library; GOG screens rotate to match mode; menu row still opens hub in all 3 menus / both modes).

## 2026-05-19 — Session checkpoint: pre12 shipped + WS5 scoping plan locked

pre12 built green (run 26125482511, commit `78b160f`), **0 SEVERE — gated** on both GOG patches; APK delivered `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.4.0-604-gog-pre12-Patched-Normal-GHL.apk` (md5 `93e4bc28de2fe88853154f461693924c`). User will device-test pre12 from home; WS4 implementation is complete pending that confirm — no further WS4 code planned. Branch `feature/gog-explore-tab` not merged (per [[feedback_bannerhub_revanced_branching]] hold-until-confirmed).

**WS5 plan locked (post-pre12-confirm):** post-install GOG → GameHub-library bridge so a downloaded GOG game appears in GameHub's library + launches via `LaunchType.GogGameByPcEmulator`. Framework already in place: `extensions/.../gog/GogLaunchHelper.java` is a Phase-1 stub with the same `triggerLaunch(activity,exePath)`/`checkPendingLaunch(activity)` API as the working 3.7.4 reference at `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/bannerhub/extension/GogLaunchHelper.java`; `GogGamesActivity`/`GogGameDetailActivity` already call `triggerLaunch` post-install. Only the bridge BODY needs filling in. 3.7.4's 5.3.5 method (`MainActivity.B3(String)` reflection → `EditImportedGameInfoDialog` pre-filled) is dead on 6.0.4's KMP rewrite — needs a 6.0.4-specific recon.

User decision 2026-05-19: **investigate both approaches before picking, AFTER pre12 device-confirm.**
- **A — UI flow (mirror 5.3.5)**: find 6.0.4 equivalent of `MainActivity.B3(String)` — the obfuscated import-dialog opener with pre-filled exe; inject `checkPendingLaunch` at `com.xiaoji.egggame.MainActivity.onResume`.
- **B — Programmatic (design doc §15.3 RECOMMENDED primary)**: skip UI dialog; directly create `GameInfo`+`LaunchMethod` rows (`LaunchType.GogGameByPcEmulator`) via `xm7.u`-equivalent suspend or direct SQLite insert into the same `db_game_library.db`/`t_game_library_base`+`t_game_launch_method` the retired seeder hit.

Exe-picker logic identical either way: read GOG manifest's primary task; fall back to `bh_gog_prefs.gog_exe` for single-exe. Both will need one recon piece. Resume on user's "pre12 confirmed → start WS5" signal.

## 2026-05-19 — GOG pre13: fix auto-rotate (`fullSensor` → `behind`); §34a

User device-tested pre12: APK manifest correct (`aapt dump xmltree` shows all 6 GOG activities `screenOrientation=0xa=fullSensor`), no programmatic locks in the Activity Java, no theme lock — but the GOG hub does NOT auto-rotate when opened. Root cause: **wrong target value.** `fullSensor` = follow device sensor; the user wants **mode-driven** (match GameHub's current handheld/explore mode). Also the §32b reasoning was wrong: I claimed `behind` would fall back to portrait because of NEW_TASK, but `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` only spawns a new task across different `taskAffinity`s — the default affinity is the app package (same for GogMainActivity and GameHub MainActivity), so GOG launches into GameHub's SAME task. MainActivity (programmatically `setRequestedOrientation()`-locked to landscape in handheld / portrait in explore) is the activity behind ours. **pre13:** change all 6 GOG activities from `fullSensor` → `behind` — inherits MainActivity's runtime orientation at launch, so the GOG hub opens in whichever mode you're in. `configChanges` already set → smooth in-place re-layout if mode changes while the hub is open. Manifest-only, zero bytecode risk. Files: `GogManifestPatch.kt`, `GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md` §34a. WS5 plan unchanged (still investigate A vs B after this orientation fix lands). Next: compile gate → grep SEVERE → pre13 → device.

## 2026-05-19 — GOG pre14: WS5 bridge — programmatic DB insert + auto-launch (§35)

User device-confirmed pre13 (`behind` rotation works). Investigated WS5 A vs B across 6.0.4 bytecode + a live capture of the GameHub import button (45/90s logcat windows): MainActivity.onResume + DocumentsUI + Intent filters all confirm the import flow is **entirely Compose-internal** — `AppNavKey.PcImportEdit` (data class `Lnf0;`, single-String ctor = exePath) is reachable only via `Lgme;->i(navKey)` where `Lgme;` is a Compose-scoped NavController not exposed as a singleton. Approach A (mirror 5.3.5 `B3()` reflection) is dead. Approach C (patch MainActivity to handle a new `app_nav_target=pc_import_edit` extra) still requires extracting NavController from Compose state — same blocker. **Approach B (programmatic Room DB insert) wins** — and the recovered retired-seeder code revealed we don't even need Room/Hilt/Continuation: raw `SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase(ctx.getDatabasePath("db_game_library.db"))` works, same pattern the pre4-pre11 seeder used in production.

Open questions §35.4 resolved by dumping user's live `db_game_library.db` (1 row: God of War, imported PC game). Byte-verified shape:
- `start_type` = **1409** = `LaunchType.GogGameByPcEmulator.id` (0x581) — NOT the ordinal `0xb` I'd assumed; verified via LaunchType.smali:455-472 (PcEmulator 1403, Steam 1407, Epic 1408, Gog 1409).
- `extension_type` / `user_id` = **self-derive** from any existing row (same pattern as retired seeder); fallbacks `1` / `"99999"` (FakeUserAccount bypass) when library is empty.
- `extension_data` JSON shape (modeled byte-for-byte on God of War's row): `{gameId, isLocalGame:true, coverImage, name, startType, gogId, exePath}` — the `exePath` field is the load-bearing one; the rest is cosmetic.
- Auto-launch: fire `Intent` → `com.xiaoji.egggame.MainActivity` with `app_nav_target=local_game_launch` + `app_nav_game_id=<gameRowId>`. MainActivity handles this at smali:134-200 (line 173) — no patch needed.

**pre14 implementation:**
- `GogLaunchHelper.triggerLaunch(activity, gogGame, exePath)` (new convenience overload) and the underlying 5-arg form take `(activity, exePath, gogId, title, coverUrl)`. The original 2-arg call is kept as a deprecated ABI shim that just logs+toasts (no row writable without metadata).
- Inside `triggerLaunch`: open `db_game_library.db` RW; self-derive `extension_type`/`user_id`; idempotent DELETE for `id="gog_"+gogId` then 2-row INSERT (launch-method → library-base with FK); build `extension_data` JSON via `JSONObject` with manual-escape fallback; dispatch `local_game_launch` deep-link; finish() the GOG activity. Fail-safe by construction — any throw → log + toast, never crashes GOG flow.
- All 5 call sites updated: 4 in `GogGamesActivity` (Add Game / Add to Launcher / custom install dialog) pass `game` (full `GogGame`); 1 in `GogGameDetailActivity` passes `(exe, gameId, title, imageUrl)` since detail activity stores those as fields.

Files: `GogLaunchHelper.java` (rewrite — ~200 LOC vs 56 stub; pure `android.database.sqlite` + `org.json` deps, zero third-party), `GogGamesActivity.java` (4 call sites), `GogGameDetailActivity.java` (1 call site), `GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md` §35 (recon writeup) + status header. Next: compile gate → grep SEVERE → pre14 → device test (download a GOG game → tap "Add to Launcher" → game should appear in GameHub library and Wine-launch via existing GogGameByPcEmulator pipeline). The `checkPendingLaunch` body remains a no-op (kept for ABI compat); the optional onResume hook is not needed since the deep-link path is synchronous.

## 2026-05-19 — GOG pre15: Add-to-library refresh — Room InvalidationTracker kick (§37)

User device-tested pre14: the programmatic DB-insert bridge works end-to-end (game IS in `t_game_library_base`/`t_game_launch_method`, Wine-launches fine via `GogGameByPcEmulator`), **but** the GameHub library UI doesn't reflect the new game until the app is closed and reopened. Root cause: GameHub's library is Room-backed (`GameLibraryDatabase` extends R8'd `Llyi;` = `RoomDatabase`; library Compose surface observes Flow/LiveData from `GameLibraryBaseDao`/`GameLaunchMethodDao` via Hilt-scoped repository singletons). Our raw `SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase` write opens a **separate SQLite connection** from Room's. The SQL triggers Room installed on `t_game_library_base` / `t_game_launch_method` DO fire for our writes (triggers are SQL-level, fire for ANY writer on the file) — so `room_table_modification_log` correctly marks the tables dirty. But Room's `InvalidationTracker` only polls that log when Room itself initiates a write. Bypassing Room = no notification = observers stuck on pre-write snapshot. Cold restart works because the new process re-builds Room and re-queries the DAO from disk.

**pre15 fix:** new `RoomRefreshHelper.refreshLibrary(ctx)` reflectively reaches a live `GameLibraryDatabase` and calls `getInvalidationTracker().refresh()`. Resolution path: BFS-walk instance fields from `Application` (Hilt's SingletonC component is held in there somewhere), match runtime class simple-name `GameLibraryDatabase` (or `_Impl`); call the public `getInvalidationTracker()` method (Room codegen forces the *_Impl override → name preserved through R8); on the returned tracker, find the unique no-arg, non-static, void-returning declared method (R8 renamed the actual `refresh()` to `a()` but the signature `()V` is uniquely identifiable among the tracker's own declared methods — only `a()V` and `b(Continuation)Object;` exist on `Lhsa;`). Wire-in is one line in `GogLaunchHelper.triggerLaunch` between `registerInLibrary` and `dispatchLaunch`. Fail-safe: any reflection miss logs+returns; behavior degrades to pre14 state (restart still works). Cached after first success.

Why reflection (not Hilt EntryPoints or direct DAO calls): (a) Room and its DAOs are R8-shrunk + name-obfuscated, so `androidx.room.*` doesn't exist at compile-time-against-runtime — only `Llyi;`/`Lhsa;`/anonymous classes do; (b) Hilt EntryPoints require a compile-time interface the Hilt processor generated bindings for — we have none; (c) the field-walk is one-shot then cached. Walks budget capped at 4000 visited refs.

Files: `RoomRefreshHelper.java` (NEW — ~180 LOC, pure JDK reflection + `android.util.Log`, zero new deps), `GogLaunchHelper.java` (+1 call site, +4 lines comment). Next: compile gate → grep SEVERE → pre15 → device test (download a GOG game → tap "Add to library" → game should appear in GameHub library WITHOUT closing the app).

## 2026-05-20 — GOG pre16: separate Add-to-library from Launch (no auto-launch on "Add Game")

User device-confirmed pre15: §37 InvalidationTracker kick works — the GOG game appears in GameHub's library WITHOUT closing the app. ✅ Bug closed. New request: **don't launch the game from "Add to library" / "Add Game" / "Add to Launcher" buttons** — those should be add-only. The explicit "Launch" button in `GogGameDetailActivity` should keep its launch behavior.

Pre14/15 wired all 5 call sites through one `triggerLaunch` (add + Wine launch + finish). Splitting:

- **New `GogLaunchHelper.addToLibrary(activity, game, exePath)`** + 5-arg overload: `registerInLibrary` → `RoomRefreshHelper.refreshLibrary` → toast `Added "<name>" to library`. NO `dispatchLaunch`, NO `activity.finish()` — user stays on the GogGamesActivity and can keep adding more games (e.g. from an Add Game dialog they popped).
- **`triggerLaunch` unchanged** — still does register + refresh + Wine launch + finish, for the Launch button.

Call site reassignment (sed-driven, surgical):
- `GogGamesActivity.java` × 4 (lines 744, 1008, 1166, 1228 — all labelled "Add Game" / "Add to Launcher" buttons): `triggerLaunch` → `addToLibrary`.
- `GogGameDetailActivity.java` × 1 (line 325 — the green "Launch" button): kept on `triggerLaunch`.

Idempotency preserved: `registerInLibrary` already does DELETE-first INSERT keyed on `gog_<gogId>`, so re-tapping "Add to library" is safe — overwrites the row with current title/cover/exe and re-fires the refresh kick.

Files: `GogLaunchHelper.java` (+~30 LOC `addToLibrary` methods), `GogGamesActivity.java` (4 call sites). Next: compile gate → grep SEVERE → pre16 → device test.

## 2026-05-20 — GOG pre17: no in-GOG launching at all; Launch button → Add to Library; dead launch path removed (§38)

User clarification (post-pre16 design): **no button inside any GOG screen launches the game.** The only post-download action is adding to GameHub's library; the user launches manually from the GameHub library tile like any other PC import. The pre16 split kept `triggerLaunch` for the green "Launch" button in `GogGameDetailActivity`; pre17 retires that button entirely.

Changes:
- `GogGameDetailActivity` line 322: relabel `launchBtn` from "Launch" → "Add to Library" (color stays 0xFF2E7D32 green — still the primary action), switch its `onClickListener` from `triggerLaunch` → `addToLibrary`. The field name `launchBtn` is preserved (visibility/enable logic at lines 110, 427, 573 still applies — "shown only when installed", "disabled while downloading"). Renaming the field is pure churn for no behavior change.
- `GogLaunchHelper.java`: delete `triggerLaunch(activity, exePath, gogId, title, coverUrl)` (45 LOC), delete `triggerLaunch(activity, exePath)` legacy ABI stub (8 LOC), delete `dispatchLaunch(activity, gameRowId)` helper (13 LOC), delete `checkPendingLaunch(activity)` Phase-1 no-op (4 LOC), drop the now-unused `android.content.Intent` import. File-level Javadoc rewritten — the "fires an Intent to MainActivity / auto-launches" description was stale.
- No call site referenced `checkPendingLaunch` or the 2-arg `triggerLaunch` legacy stub — both were defensive bridges from the very-early Phase-1 GogLaunchHelper stub. Safe to remove.

This locks in the user's mental model: GOG screens are about library management (login → owned games → download → add to library). The launch surface is GameHub's library tab, where they pick a row and tap as they would for an EGS/Steam/Epic import. Removes ambiguity about what "Launch" means inside the GOG hub (vs. opening the original GOG game launcher EXE vs. the Wine container).

Idempotency unchanged — `registerInLibrary` still does DELETE-first INSERT on `gog_<gogId>`. RoomRefreshHelper §37 fix still fires on every add. Toast `Added "<name>" to library` is the user-visible confirmation.

Files: `GogLaunchHelper.java` (−70 LOC dead launch code, +file-Javadoc rewrite), `GogGameDetailActivity.java` (1-line button relabel + 1-line call switch), `GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md` §38 (UX spec). Next: compile gate → grep SEVERE → pre17 → device test (verify NO Launch button anywhere on GOG screens; verify "Add to Library" in detail page works exactly like the list-page Add buttons).

## 2026-05-20 — GOG pre18: drop orphan `triggerLaunch(GogGame)` overload

pre17 (`276a78c`) failed to compile — the 5-arg `triggerLaunch` body was deleted but the 4-arg `triggerLaunch(Activity, GogGame, String)` convenience overload still delegated to it. pre18 (`7bcdc53`, run 26134770596 ✅) drops the orphan overload. APK delivered `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.4.0-604-gog-pre18-Patched-Normal-GHL.apk` (md5 `7e6b43955aedd0e4d8f6dca2ca40fe0b`). Files: `GogLaunchHelper.java` (−14 LOC orphan).

## 2026-05-20 — GOG pre19: diagnostic toasts on RoomRefreshHelper decision branches

User device-tested pre18: Add-to-Library writes the row but the library still doesn't appear until cold restart — pre15 §37 fix has regressed silently OR the deep-link Intent pre15 also dispatched was doing the real refresh work. To find out, pre19 (`bca1cac`, run 26137182820 ✅) adds a `diagToast(ctx, msg)` helper inside `RoomRefreshHelper` that mirrors a string both to `Log.i("BannerHub", "RR-TOAST: "+msg)` and a main-thread `Toast.LENGTH_LONG` — wired into every decision branch (walk start, DB not reachable, DB found, getInvalidationTracker missing/failed, tracker null/resolved, no-arg method missing/picked, invoke OK/FAILED). Disposable diagnostic. Files: `RoomRefreshHelper.java` (+31 LOC, +Handler/Looper/Toast imports).

## 2026-05-20 — GOG pre20: REORDER_TO_FRONT MainActivity nudge to force recomposition (§39)

User device-tested pre19. Logcat (`getlog gamehub.lite | grep -E 'BannerHub|RoomRefresh|RR-TOAST'`) showed the full success path: `RR: walk start` → `RR: DB found = GameLibraryDatabase_Impl` → `RR: tracker = hsa` → `RR: picked method a() on hsa` → `RoomRefresh: notified Room InvalidationTracker` → `RR: invoke OK on a`. All ~120 ms. **Reflection is healthy** — pre15 hypothesis (a) (silently-failing reflection) is RULED OUT. Hypothesis (b) confirmed: `tracker.refresh()` (the R8-renamed `a()` on `Lhsa;`) is necessary but **not sufficient** to make the library Flow re-emit for an externally-written row.

Why: Room's `InvalidationTracker.refresh()` enqueues a scan of `room_table_modification_log` via `mQueryExecutor`. The log rows ARE there (our triggers fire at SQL level for any writer), but `notifyObserversByTableNames` checks for a **version-count delta** in the tracker's in-memory `mTableVersions` array — that array is bumped only by Room-internal write paths, not by our raw `SQLiteDatabase` write. The async scan sees rows, finds no version delta vs cached state, exits without notifying. pre15 looked correct because it ALSO dispatched `Intent app_nav_target=local_game_launch` to MainActivity — that path made MainActivity recompose, which re-collected the library Flow from Room fresh. The tracker call was decorative.

**pre20 fix:** restore the recomposition kick, sans the auto-launch payload (§38 still in force). New `GogLaunchHelper.dispatchLibraryRefreshNudge(activity)` fires an Intent at `com.xiaoji.egggame.MainActivity` with `FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT` and a `bh_refresh_only=true` marker extra (purely a debug breadcrumb — no Intent receiver acts on it). `REORDER_TO_FRONT` brings MainActivity to the top of the existing task without clearing intermediate GOG activities. MainActivity's `onResume` + Compose recomposition fires → library Flow re-collects from Room → newly-inserted row visible. User backs out through the stack into a library that's already up to date — no app restart. Called after `RoomRefreshHelper.refreshLibrary(activity)` in `addToLibrary`; the tracker kick stays in place since it's harmless and may help in cases where the recomposition alone isn't enough. pre19's `diagToast` machinery is stripped in the same commit — answers known, on-screen toasts are now noise. `Log.i`/`Log.w` calls in each branch are retained for future debugging.

Files: `GogLaunchHelper.java` (+`android.content.Intent` import, +`dispatchLibraryRefreshNudge`, +1 call site, +file-Javadoc §39 paragraph), `RoomRefreshHelper.java` (−`diagToast`, −Handler/Looper/Toast imports, −9 diag call sites, ~−35 LOC net), `GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN.md` §39 (root cause + fix writeup). Next: compile gate → grep SEVERE → pre20 → device test (download a GOG game → tap "Add to Library" → MainActivity briefly surfaces → user backs out → library shows the row, no restart).
## 2026-05-20 — External launcher (Beacon / ES-DE / Daijishou) port to 6.0.4 (branch `feature/external-launcher`)

Ports PlayDay's 5.3.5 `ExternalLauncherPatch` ("External launcher support") to GameHub 6.0.4. The 5.3.5 hook (`Lcom/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/gamedetail/GameDetailActivity;->initView` + `<intent-filter>` on `GameDetailActivity`) is dead — 6.0.4 has no `GameDetailActivity` (game detail is a Compose screen reached via Compose navigation).

**Discovery — 6.0.4 already has the dispatch natively.** `com.xiaoji.egggame.DeepLinkActivity.onCreate` consumes:
- `app_nav_target` = `"game_detail"` (sswitch_8 hash `-0x19542ac2`, at ~line 3507 of the 6.0.4 smali)
- `app_nav_game_id` (String → int via `Liml;->t0`)
- `app_nav_steam_app_id` (int)
- `app_nav_auto_start_game` (boolean — already powers auto-launch!)
- plus `app_nav_source_id` / `_type` / `_slug` / `app_nav_epic_app_name` as optional metadata

So the port is purely extras-translation glue — no need to rewrite the dispatch.

**New files (branch `feature/external-launcher` off `gamehub-604-build@27d98d4`):**

- `extensions/gamehub/src/main/java/app/revanced/extension/gamehub/launcher/ExternalLauncher.java`
  - `static void rewriteIntent(Activity activity, Intent intent)`
  - Matches action via `activity.getPackageName() + ".LAUNCH_GAME"` (per-variant) PLUS the literal `gamehub.lite.LAUNCH_GAME` as a forgiveness fallback for users who copy/paste old 5.3.5-Lite-style Beacon configs against a renamed BannerHub variant.
  - Translates `localGameId` / `steamAppId` / `autoStartGame` → `app_nav_game_id` / `app_nav_steam_app_id` / `app_nav_auto_start_game` + sets `app_nav_target=game_detail` + `target_type=game_detail`.
  - localGameId wins over steamAppId; fall back to steamAppId if localGameId is missing.
  - `type` extra (5.3.5-only) ignored — 6.0.4 dispatcher doesn't need it.
  - Logs to tag `BhExternalLauncher` for getlog verification.

- `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/gamehub/misc/launcher/ExternalLauncherPatch.kt`
  - Private `externalLauncherManifestPatch` (resourcePatch, `afterDependents`, depends on `changePackageNamePatch`): finds `com.xiaoji.egggame.DeepLinkActivity` in `AndroidManifest.xml`, sets `android:exported="true"` defensively (already true in 6.0.4), and appends an `<intent-filter>` with `<action android:name="$variantPackage.LAUNCH_GAME"/>` + `DEFAULT` category. Variant package read via `packageNameOption.value?.takeIf { it != packageNameOption.default } ?: manifestPackage` (same idiom as `FileManagerAccessPatch`). Idempotency-checked by suffix `.LAUNCH_GAME`.
  - Public `externalLauncherPatch` (bytecodePatch): depends on `sharedGamehubExtensionPatch` + `externalLauncherManifestPatch`. Injects 3 instructions at index 0 of `Lcom/xiaoji/egggame/DeepLinkActivity;->onCreate(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V`:
    ```smali
    invoke-virtual {p0}, Landroid/app/Activity;->getIntent()Landroid/content/Intent;
    move-result-object v0
    invoke-static {p0, v0}, Lapp/revanced/extension/gamehub/launcher/ExternalLauncher;->rewriteIntent(Landroid/app/Activity;Landroid/content/Intent;)V
    ```
    v0 reuse is safe — the original method's next instruction (`sget-object v0, Lejm;->a:Lghd;`) writes v0 but its result is never read.

**Beacon instructions delta for 6.0.4.** The per-variant `<package>.LAUNCH_GAME` action names in `/storage/emulated/0/Download/beacon instructions.txt` stay correct. The only change is the activity component — `com.xj.landscape.launcher.ui.gamedetail.GameDetailActivity` → `com.xiaoji.egggame.DeepLinkActivity` for ALL variants (the activity FQN sits in the `com.xiaoji.egggame.*` namespace and is unaffected by `ChangePackageNamePatch`, which only rewrites `manifest@package`). Example for the default Lite variant:

```
am launch -n gamehub.lite/com.xiaoji.egggame.DeepLinkActivity \
  -a gamehub.lite.LAUNCH_GAME \
  --es localGameId {file_content} --es steamAppId {file_content} \
  --ez autoStartGame true
```

**Re-derivation on future base bumps.** `DeepLinkActivity` is at the package root (not behind R8 letter renames) — stable. Native `app_nav_*` extra names appear as const-string literals in `onCreate`'s smali — grep to verify they still feed the same dispatch on a future base.

Pending: CI dispatch on `feature/external-launcher`, per-patch SEVERE check on the run log per `[[feedback_revanced_verify_patch_applied]]`, device test (Lite variant first via Beacon).

## 2026-05-20 (cont.) — `extlaunch-pre1` Release SEVERE'd → smali register-limit fix

`Build pull request` compiled green ([run 26159954724](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26159954724)) but that workflow does NOT invoke revanced-cli, so it only validates Kotlin compilation. Dispatched artifact-only Release ([run 26160401818](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26160401818), version `1.4.0-604-extlaunch-pre1`, `stable=false`) to get the actual patch-apply check. All 4 patch jobs reported `SEVERE: "External launcher support" failed` with `app.revanced.patcher.patch.PatchException: Collection is empty` — classic silent-no-apply per `[[feedback_revanced_verify_patch_applied]]`. Underlying smali error (printed above the SEVERE line in the log):

```
[5,16] The maximum allowed register in this context is list of registers is v15
[5,0] Cannot invoke "Object.hashCode()" because "key" is null
[5,56] mismatched tree node: UP expecting I_CATCHES
[3,0] A non-abstract/non-native method must have at least 1 instruction
[7,24] mismatched tree node: Lapp/revanced/extension/gamehub/launcher/ExternalLauncher; expecting I_FIELDS
```

Root cause: `DeepLinkActivity.onCreate` declares `.locals 34`, which aliases `p0` to `v34`. The injected `invoke-static {p0, v0}, ...` uses the non-range invoke form, which only accepts 4-bit register references (`v0`–`v15`). `v34` blew that limit on the FIRST register slot, the assembler bailed, the rest of the cascade followed.

**Fix:** drop the `Activity` parameter entirely from the extension. The Intent's action string already contains the variant package (`<pkg>.LAUNCH_GAME`), so we can check `action.endsWith(".LAUNCH_GAME")` without ever calling `getPackageName()`. That collapses the smali to two single-register invokes (`{p0}` alone, then `{v0}` alone), both of which are valid even with `.locals 34`:

```smali
invoke-virtual {p0}, Landroid/app/Activity;->getIntent()Landroid/content/Intent;
move-result-object v0
invoke-static {v0}, Lapp/revanced/extension/gamehub/launcher/ExternalLauncher;->rewriteIntent(Landroid/content/Intent;)V
```

Behavioral equivalence preserved — `endsWith(".LAUNCH_GAME")` matches every per-variant action AND the literal `gamehub.lite.LAUNCH_GAME` PlayDay-compatibility fallback in one expression.

**Lesson captured for memory:** when injecting into a method with `.locals >= 16`, every `invoke-…` that uses the non-range form must be checked — any `p0` reference becomes `v(locals)` and silently exceeds the 4-bit register cap. Solutions: (a) drop the receiver/Activity parameter and pull state from the Intent or other low-register sources; (b) `move-object/from16 vLow, p0` first; (c) use `/range` form with a contiguous register window. Option (a) is cleanest when feasible.

## 2026-05-20 (cont.) — `extlaunch-pre2` SEVERE'd again; `{p0}` ALSO violates 4-bit limit

pre2 ([run 26161013383](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26161013383)) still SEVERE'd on all 9 variants. The `[5,16] maximum register v15` line was gone (so the `{p0, v0}` → `{v0}` simplification worked), but a more subtle cascade remained:

```
[5,0] Cannot invoke "Object.hashCode()" because "key" is null
[5,56] mismatched tree node: UP expecting I_CATCHES
[3,0] A non-abstract/non-native method must have at least 1 instruction
[7,20] mismatched tree node: Lapp/revanced/extension/gamehub/launcher/ExternalLauncher; expecting I_FIELDS
```

The smali assembler NPE'd on `invoke-virtual {p0}` because `{p0}` is ALSO the non-range form (format 35c), and `p0 = v34` blows the 4-bit register field. Unlike the `{p0, v0}` case, this didn't get a clean "register out of range" error — the assembler crashed internally on a null `key.hashCode()` lookup mid-emit, then the parser tried to recover and emitted nonsense follow-ups. The fix is the canonical move-down dance — same recipe as `VibrationPatch`'s `ENV_BUILDER->a` hook:

```smali
move-object/from16 v0, p0
invoke-virtual {v0}, Landroid/app/Activity;->getIntent()Landroid/content/Intent;
move-result-object v0
invoke-static {v0}, Lapp/revanced/extension/gamehub/launcher/ExternalLauncher;->rewriteIntent(Landroid/content/Intent;)V
```

`move-object/from16 vA, vBBBB` accepts any 16-bit source register, so it can read `p0=v34` into `v0`. Then every subsequent invoke operates on `v0` (low register) and the 4-bit limit never bites. v0 reuse remains safe because the original `onCreate`'s first instruction (`sget-object v0, Lejm;->a:Lghd;`) overwrites it on the very next instruction without ever reading the prior value.

**Lesson reinforced:** when `.locals >= 16`, every reference to `p0` in a non-range smali instruction is suspect — not just multi-register invokes. The minimal-cost cure is one `move-object/from16 vLow, p0` at the head of the injected block, then operate exclusively on `vLow`. Doc'd as a follow-up pattern next to `VibrationPatch`'s precedent.

## 2026-05-20 (cont.) — `extlaunch-pre3` applied cleanly + user-driven discovery of extra-type bug (pre4)

`extlaunch-pre3` ([run 26161429594](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26161429594)) green across all 9 variants: `"External launcher support" succeeded`, 0 SEVERE. Lite (Normal-GHL) APK at `/storage/emulated/0/Download/extlaunch-pre3/BannerHub-V6-1.4.0-604-extlaunch-pre3-Patched-Normal-GHL.apk` md5 not captured.

**User-driven device-side bug surfaced while building the test command.** User wired a Beacon entry with `--es localGameId {file_content} --es steamAppId {file_content} --ez autoStartGame true`. The `--es` form puts STRING extras, but `ExternalLauncher.rewriteIntent` was reading via `intent.getIntExtra("localGameId", -1)`. `getIntExtra` returns the default when the actual extra type is String → both ids resolved to `-1` → patch bailed with the "no usable id" log → no rewrite → DeepLinkActivity finished without navigating.

This explains why a correct numeric `server_game_id` would also have failed against pre3 — the extra-type mismatch is on the read side, independent of what the user puts in the file.

**Schema-driven discovery alongside.** The user's library DBs were dumped via the root bridge (`getlog --cat` for `.db` + `.db-wal` + `.db-shm`, then `python3 -m sqlite3`-style query because `/system/bin/sqlite3` isn't present on the device):

- `gamehub.lite/databases/db_game_library.db` → Dead Cells (server_game_id `10417`), God of War (`49908`), Gunslugs (`0` — GOG, not deep-link-addressable)
- `banner.hub/databases/db_game_library.db` → Blur (`-1` — not addressable), Dirt 3 (`131962`), God of War (`49908`), PRAGMATA (`135805`)

Important consequence: 6.0.4's `t_game_library_base.id` is TEXT with prefixes like `local_*` / `gog_*` — those cannot be parsed by the dispatch's `Liml;->t0(radix 10, String)` Integer-parse step. The 5.3.5-style numeric `localGameId` arg only maps onto 6.0.4's INTEGER `server_game_id` column. The "Show game IDs" menu-row patch (queued) must surface `server_game_id` as the user-facing "Local Game ID", not the raw `id` TEXT.

**Fix in pre4 (commit pending).** `ExternalLauncher.readIdExtra(intent, key)` now reads `getStringExtra` first and `Integer.parseInt(trim())` it; falls back to `getIntExtra` for any future caller using `--ei`. Bad String values are logged but treated as missing (no crash). Same idea for `autoStartGame` via `readBoolExtra`, since `--ez` and `--es "true"` are both plausible — `--ez` is preferred but the String form is tolerated.

## 2026-05-20 (cont.) — `extlaunch-pre4` device-confirmed end-to-end + Epic gap → pre5

`extlaunch-pre4` ([run 26162931869](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26162931869)) green across all 9 variants. md5 of Normal-GHL APK = `a78178e0d42a8b3b3b554ab48b40e32b`.

**Device-confirmed paths (1.4.0-604-extlaunch-pre4 on `gamehub.lite`):**
1. **PC-imported (`source_type=0`)** — God of War (`server_game_id=49908`, `id="local_YigsP7W-…"`). Beacon `--es localGameId 49908 --ez autoStartGame true` → `ActivityTaskManager: START act=gamehub.lite.LAUNCH_GAME cmp=…/com.xiaoji.egggame.DeepLinkActivity` → `GameDetailViewModel: loadGameDetail rendered from local library after server/steam/epic failed. id=, sourceId=49908, sourceType=1` → `WinEmuModule: startGame(null-49908-1593500)` → Wine pipeline launched `GoW.exe`. End-to-end works.
2. **Steam-library (`source_type=1`)** — Brawlhalla (`id == server_game_id == steam_app_id == 291550`). Beacon `--es localGameId 291550` resolved via server-lookup branch (not fallback). User-confirmed working.
3. **Epic-library (`source_type=2`)** — DOOMBLADE (`id == epic_app_name == "818572d480784b9a904e54aab004d1c4"`, `server_game_id=0`). **Pre4 cannot launch this** — the 32-char hex UUID fails `Liml;->t0` Integer parse on `app_nav_game_id`, and `server_game_id=0` is the only numeric handle (a "no catalog id" sentinel, not addressable).

**Cosmetic note:** the `Log.i(TAG="BhExternalLauncher")` line didn't surface in the captured logcat for the pre4 test even with `-n 20000` unfiltered. System-side `ActivityTaskManager` log + GameHub's own `GameDetailViewModel` log together prove the rewrite happened (without our extension, `app_nav_game_id` wouldn't be populated from the Beacon `--es localGameId` extra). Possibly device-level Log.i filter; not gating anything.

**Pre5 extension change for Epic support.** Same Beacon command template; the user just puts the right handle in the per-game `.iso/.txt` file:
- PC-import / Steam-library → numeric `server_game_id`
- Epic-library → 32-char hex `epic_app_name` UUID

`ExternalLauncher.rewriteIntent` now:
1. Reads `localGameId` as String, tries `Integer.parseInt`.
2. If parse fails AND the string matches the Epic UUID shape (hex, ≥8 chars), treats it as `epicAppName`.
3. Explicit `--es epicAppName <uuid>` extra is also accepted (preferred for callers that want to be explicit).
4. Epic branch sets:
   - `target_type = app_nav_target = "game_detail"`
   - `app_nav_game_id = "0"` (the dispatch's "no catalog id" sentinel — required because the Integer parse must succeed; without it the dispatch bails)
   - `app_nav_epic_app_name = <uuid>`
   - `app_nav_source_type = 2`
   - `app_nav_auto_start_game = <bool>`
5. PC / Steam branch unchanged.

This is still partly speculative — the `game_id=0` + `epic_app_name=<uuid>` combination needs device verification against DOOMBLADE. If the dispatch ignores `epic_app_name` when `game_id` is 0, the fix is more invasive (e.g. construct the navigation route manually rather than going through the int-game-id dispatch).

## 2026-05-20 (cont.) — `extlaunch-pre5` Epic device test FAILED → ship as PC+Steam only

`extlaunch-pre5` ([run 26165219171](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/actions/runs/26165219171)) applied cleanly across all 9 variants (0 SEVERE). Normal-GHL APK md5 `a3b329f6b32e777a66b48693c2327d3e`.

**Device test result for DOOMBLADE (Epic-library):** `BhExternalLauncher: rewrote gamehub.lite.LAUNCH_GAME → epic game_detail epicAppName=818572d480784b9a904e54aab004d1c4 autoStart=true` — extension fired correctly and set the Epic extras. But `GameDetailViewModel` logged: `[Issue#1753] loadGameDetail fallback exhausted → show empty. id=0, sourceId=, sourceType=-1, apiError=Business error: code=401, message=Please login first`. The dispatch's `app_nav_source_type` and `app_nav_epic_app_name` extras were ignored by the ViewModel — only `app_nav_game_id` (which we set to `"0"` as the Epic sentinel) propagated, and the resulting `loadGameDetail(0)` failed all branches (server lookup 401'd against the fake-login; steam/epic/local-fallback all failed because no row matched `_id`/`server_game_id`/`id` against `0`).

**Architectural conclusion.** The 6.0.4 `DeepLinkActivity` dispatch is fundamentally Integer-game-id-based, and the server-resolution branch hits Steam's catalog via `server_game_id` / Steam appid. Epic-library entries have no usable numeric handle (their unique identifier is the 32-char hex `epic_app_name` UUID, stored in `t_game_library_base.id` AND `epic_app_name` columns; `server_game_id=0`). For PC and Steam games the catalog API bridges `server_game_id` → the right local row, so Beacon works. For Epic that bridge doesn't exist in the deep-link surface at all.

**Evidence the in-app library-tile path goes elsewhere.** When the user tapped DOOMBLADE in GameHub Lite's library, the launch chain was `MainActivity → (Compose nav, NO DeepLinkActivity) → WineActivity` — taskId 10286, no DeepLinkActivity in the trace. The launch method's `extension_data` JSON drives the launch:
```json
{
  "gameId": "818572d480784b9a904e54aab004d1c4",
  "name": "DOOMBLADE",
  "startType": 1408,
  "exePath": "/data/user/0/gamehub.lite/files/xj_winemu/xj_install/game/<uuid>",
  "gameDir": "/data/user/0/gamehub.lite/files/xj_winemu/xj_install/game/<uuid>"
}
```
`start_type=1408` is the Epic launch flow; `start_type=1407` is Steam; `start_type=1403` is PC-import. The library-tile code path reads `t_game_launch_method.extension_data` (NOT the deep-link extras) and invokes `WineActivity` with the right args.

**Side-discovery: `_id=10` resolves to Counter-Strike on Steam.** When testing with DOOMBLADE's `_id` (`10`), Beacon dispatched to CS:GO's storefront. Steam appid `10` IS Counter-Strike, so the server-lookup branch hit Steam's catalog directly. Confirms the dispatch is Steam-appid-centric for its primary lookup, with local-fallback only used when server lookup fails AND the row has a matching `server_game_id`.

**Ship decision.** Pre5 is final for the External-launcher feature. Three Epic-support paths exist (hook MainActivity / direct-to-WineActivity / patch GameDetailViewModel) but each is a multi-iteration patch project on the scale of `VibrationMenuRowPatch` — not worth blocking the PC+Steam-supported feature. Ship pre5 as the External-launcher feature; document Epic + GOG as library-tile-only in release notes and the beacon instructions txt.

**Beacon contract (final for this branch):**

| Game type | What goes in the per-game `.iso/.txt` file |
|---|---|
| PC-imported (`source_type=0`) | numeric `server_game_id` from `t_game_library_base` (e.g. `49908` for God of War) |
| Steam-library (`source_type=1`) | numeric `server_game_id`, which equals the Steam appid for these rows (e.g. `291550` for Brawlhalla) |
| Epic-library (`source_type=2`) | **Not supported via Beacon** — launch from GameHub's library tile directly |
| GOG-imported (`server_game_id=0`) | **Not supported via Beacon** — same reason as Epic |

## 2026-05-20 (cont.) — Show Game ID menu row + View All Games dialog (`gameid-pre1`, MERGED to 604 + Lite)

Companion to External Launcher (above): users wiring Beacon / ES-DE / Daijishou had no in-app way to read the `server_game_id` GameHub uses — they had to grep logcat. New menu row surfaces it directly in all three per-game popup menus, and a "View All Games" button on the dialog walks the entire library DB so any game's id can be copied without browsing per-tile.

### Patch layout — clone of the vibration / gpuspoof menu-row family

- `patches/.../gameid/GameIdDisplayMenuRowPatch.kt` — three injection sites (`Lx57;->a` More Menu / `Lted;->f` library-tile popup / `Lpzc;->j0` library-list popup), each a single `invoke-static {vN}, BhGameIdDisplayMenuRowClick;->append…(Object)…` that hands row construction to a Java helper (no register clobbering, no verifier risk). `dependsOn(menuGameIdCapturePatch, vibrationMenuRowPatch, gameIdDisplayMenuLabelPatch)` — explicitly reuses the shared `Lxd3;->l1` resolver hook owned by `vibrationMenuRowPatch`. **No second `Lxd3;->l1` head-block** (the 2026-05-17 GpuSpoof saga proved stacking a 2nd one ANRs MainActivity cold-start); the resolver entry is added as one `else if` line in `BhMenuRowClick.maybeResolveCustomLabel` mapping `"string:bh_gameid_label" → "Show Game ID"`.
- `patches/.../gameid/GameIdDisplayMenuLabelPatch.kt` — appends `bh_gameid_label = "Show Game ID"` to `features.home`'s Compose Multiplatform `.cvr` resource bundle across the 6 locale variants (`values`, `values-en`, `values-zh-rCN`, `values-ja-rJP`, `values-pt-rBR`, `values-ru-rRU`). Resource is reachable through any future manifest-aware resolver; runtime lookup currently goes through the shared `l1` short-circuit.
- `extensions/.../gameid/BhGameIdDisplayMenuRowClick.java` — Function1 click handler + three `append*` helpers + an `AlertDialog` with `Close / Copy / View All Games` buttons. Reuses the existing `BhMenuGameId.getCaptured()` channel and the same `ActivityThread.mActivities` walk pattern every other menu-row click handler uses, so no new Context resolution surface. View All flow opens the GameHub library DB read-only and renders an `ArrayAdapter` list; tap row → copy that game's `server_game_id`.

### View All Games — DB-backed library browser

Sources data from GameHub's own Room database. Schema confirmed live via `getlog --ls /data/data/banner.hub/databases/` + a python `sqlite3` read of the copied `.db` (no on-device `sqlite3` binary; PRoot can't `apt install` without root):

```
db_game_library.db → t_game_library_base
  server_game_id INTEGER  (the integer gameId external launchers expect; matches MMKV pc_g_setting<id>)
  game_name      TEXT
  steam_app_id   TEXT     (when source_type = 1)
  epic_app_name  TEXT     (when source_type = 2, the 32-char UUID — see External Launcher pre5 note)
  source_type/source_id/last_launch_time + several catalog fields
```

Read-only open with `SQLiteDatabase.OPEN_READONLY | NO_LOCALIZED_COLLATORS` works alongside the host Room writer's WAL connection — no lock contention. `getApplicationContext().getDatabasePath("db_game_library.db")` resolves relative to the variant's data dir (`banner.hub` / `com.antutu.benchmark.full` / `gamehub.lite` / etc.) so the same code reads the right DB across every variant. Absent file (Room creates it lazily on first write — fresh install with no library yet) toasts "open a game once to initialise it"; missing table / any SQLite error toasts "Couldn't open library DB". Empty library renders its own "No games yet" sub-dialog. No crash path.

### Reusable findings captured

1. **`BhMenuGameId.GAMEINFO_CLS = "com.xiaoji.egggame.game.di.model.game.GameInfo"` is dead code on 6.0.4.** `find smali* -path "*xiaoji*game*"` returns nothing under that prefix; the class doesn't exist in the base APK at all. The toString-regex path (`ServerGameId(value=<int>)` / `gameId=<int>`) is the only one that ever fires. Don't rely on the GameInfo fallback for new features — the comment in `BhMenuGameId.java` referencing kept-name `GameInfo.getServerGameId()` is from a different GameHub generation.
2. **GameHub's library catalog lives in `db_game_library.db`** — not in any of the three `*_Impl` Room classes visible in smali (`psplay/AppDatabase`, `movingrtc/SpeedTurnDatabase`, `movingrtc/RtcStateDatabase`); the GameLibrary Room class is generated under an R8-renamed `_Impl` that doesn't ship its raw name. Search by file rather than by class.
3. **Rows can have `server_game_id = -1`** (locally added non-server games — e.g. `Blur` on the device dump). The patch surfaces them anyway since that's what GameHub stores; users who pass `-1` to an external launcher get the same "no usable id" behavior they would have got otherwise.

### Merge ledger

- Feature branch `feature/menu-gameid-display`: HEAD `e928da5` (4 files, +741 LOC).
- Merged into `gamehub-604-build` at merge commit **`090706e`** (`--no-ff`).
- Back-merged into `feature/lite-variant-tier1` at merge commit **`09fa1d8`** (one-way pattern, mirrors `2d04579` for External Launcher).
- GOG branch (`feature/gog-explore-tab` HEAD `0114f75`) verified isolated — `git branch --contains 0114f75` returns nothing under 604 / Lite / main per user directive ("leave it separate until we figure out the add-game-to-GameHub-library issues").

Ships in v1.5.0-604 alongside External Launcher when the next stable is cut. Pre-release policy resumes per the BannerHub pre-release rule.

## 2026-05-29 — Explore tab hijack: BannerHub-owned Explore screen (gog-pre25)

`feature/gog-explore-tab`. New feature (GOG_LIBRARY_TAB_DESIGN §42): GameHub's bottom-nav "Explore" tab is a server-driven discovery feed from xiaoji we don't control. Rather than forge that feed (HTTP-stub + schema-RE + dead-card problem), **full-hijack the unused Explore tab → a BannerHub-owned classic-Java screen** (bundled JSON, GOG rail only in v1). Avoids all 3 high-risk classes: no Compose authoring, no obfuscated-enum surgery, no feed-schema RE.

**Spike (§42.4):** bottom-nav controller = ViewModel `w1a` (classes5). Tab-select converges on `q(Lyw9;)V` — UI tap (n(r1a)→q) AND programmatic deep-links (zu9 home_tab_selection_request→q). `w1a` is a SINGLE shared VM for both handheld+explore modes (ctor builds both tab orderings) → one seam, both modes (solves §33). `yw9` tab enum: HOME(0)=Explore bar item, PLAY(1), LEADERBOARD(2), LIBRARY(3), PROFILE(4). Ctor seeds default tab directly into state (not via q()) → no cold-start misfire.

**6 files:** `com/xj/winemu/explore/BhExploreTabClick.java` (`maybeHijack(Object)Z`: instanceof Enum + ordinal()==0 → resolveTopActivity ActivityThread-walk → startActivity(BannerExploreActivity); false-on-anything-else = fail-safe to native Explore); `app/.../explore/BannerExploreActivity.java` (ScrollView + per-rail HorizontalScrollView cards, dark theme, no Compose), `BhExploreManifest.java` (JSON Rail/Card model + load() asset→BUNDLED_JSON GOG-rail fallback), `BhExploreActions.java` (gog→GogMainActivity / url→ACTION_VIEW / else toast); `patches/.../explore/ExploreTabHijackPatch.kt` (fingerprint `q(Lyw9;)V` via param+returnType+const-string "main_menu"; head-inject `move-object/from16 v0,p1`→maybeHijack→`if-eqz v0,:continue`/`return-void`/`:continue`=orig via ExternalLabel; from16 dodges high-reg trap), `ExploreManifestPatch.kt` (registers activity exported=false, behind orientation). Auto-discovered (patcher 22.0.0). FQNs verified consistent across Java↔Kotlin.

**Build:** gog-pre25, artifact-only (pre-release). pre25 commit `bc1c3ae`, run 26659941618 ✅ — both patches applied all variants, 0 SEVERE. Device-confirmed: Explore tab opens our screen, GOG card → GogMainActivity, no cold-start misfire.

**pre26 — immersive fix:** pre25 device test showed the system status/notification bar (top) + navigation bar (bottom) visible over BannerExploreActivity (our base theme is plain NoTitleBar; GameHub's own screens are fullscreen). Added immersive-sticky to `BannerExploreActivity`: `hideSystemBars()` in onCreate + re-applied in `onWindowFocusChanged(hasFocus)` (so bars don't linger after dialogs / returning from GogMainActivity). WindowInsetsController `hide(statusBars|navigationBars)` + `BEHAVIOR_SHOW_TRANSIENT_BARS_BY_SWIPE` on API 30+, legacy `SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_*` (FULLSCREEN|HIDE_NAVIGATION|IMMERSIVE_STICKY + LAYOUT_*) below. Swipe from an edge reveals them transiently. Single file touched (`BannerExploreActivity.java`). **Build:** pre26 commit `a39d85d`, run 26660428763 ✅ (3m33s) — both patches applied all variants, 0 SEVERE.

**pre27 — fix pre26 crash.** Device test of pre26 on `gamehub.lite`: selecting Explore **crashed** — `NullPointerException ...DecorView.getWindowInsetsController() on a null object reference` at `PhoneWindow.getInsetsController` ← `BannerExploreActivity.hideSystemBars` ← `onCreate`. Cause: `hideSystemBars()` was called at the TOP of onCreate, **before `setContentView()`**, so the window had no DecorView yet and `window.getInsetsController()` NPE'd. Fix: (1) moved the call to AFTER `setContentView(scroller)`; (2) `hideSystemBars()` now calls `window.getDecorView()` first (forces decor creation) and uses `decor.getWindowInsetsController()` instead of `window.getInsetsController()`; (3) wrapped the whole method in try/catch (immersive is cosmetic — must never crash the screen). `onWindowFocusChanged` re-apply unchanged. **Build:** pre27 commit `7520c1f`, run 26660835873 ✅ (3m13s) — both patches applied all variants, 0 SEVERE. Single file (`BannerExploreActivity.java`). **Device-confirmed working** (pre27): Explore opens, bars hidden, GOG card → GogMainActivity, offline.

## 2026-05-29 — MERGED GOG + Explore to 604 + Lite (hold lifted) + GOG card logo

User confirmed Explore works on device and approved shipping. **GOG hold lifted** (2026-05-20 directive; add-to-library resolved §41 restart-to-show). Merged `feature/gog-explore-tab` → `gamehub-604-build` (merge `79b85ef`, clean — gog was a strict superset of 604) → one-way back-merge into `feature/lite-variant-tier1` (merge `b5f63dd`, clean). Both built green: **604 run 26661582500** (3m38s), **Lite run 26661468249** (3m24s) — all 5 patches apply on every variant incl. Lite (`Explore screen activity`, `Explore tab hijack`, `GOG activities`, `GOG library card`, `GOG menu row`), 0 SEVERE. Confirms Lite tier-strip config doesn't drop Explore/GOG.

**GOG card logo (this commit):** the Explore GOG card showed a plain purple placeholder chip. Made the card icon data-driven — `BhExploreManifest.Card` gains an optional `icon` field (android drawable NAME, resolved at runtime via `getResources().getIdentifier(icon,"drawable",pkg)`), `BannerExploreActivity.buildCard` renders an `ImageView` (FIT_CENTER, 56dp) when resolvable else the accent chip (never throws). New `ExploreDrawablesPatch` (resourcePatch, mirrors BannerToolsDrawablesPatch) copies `patches/src/main/resources/explore/bh_explore_gog.png` (user-provided GOG Galaxy macOS-BigSur icon, 512×512 RGBA, 34 KB) → `res/drawable/bh_explore_gog.png`. BUNDLED_JSON GOG card now `"icon":"bh_explore_gog"`. **Build:** 604 run 26662119568 ✅ (3m32s) + Lite run 26662120812 ✅ (3m47s) — `Explore drawables` + `Explore screen activity` + `Explore tab hijack` all apply on every variant incl. Lite, 0 SEVERE. Logo device-visual-check pending.

## 2026-05-29 — 🎯 v1.6.0-604 STABLE

User approved cutting stable 1.6.0. **Headline features on top of v1.5.1-604:** (1) **GOG integration** (login / owned-library / download / install / add-to-GameHub-library — restart-to-show, §41); (2) **BannerHub Explore screen** (hijacks unused Explore bottom-nav tab → offline BannerHub-owned screen, GOG rail w/ logo, §42); (3) **Recording-compatible audio toggle** (PulseAudio screen-record fix, Banner Tools → Audio). 77 commits since v1.5.1-604.

**Stable checklist done** (per [[feedback_stable_release_checklist]]): release notes refreshed in `release.yml` body (What's-new + "on top of v1.5.1-604" + 3 cumulative-list entries); README updated (header badge → v1.6.0-604, description line, TOC anchor, What's-new section rewritten + carryover folded, 3 new Patches-applied entries, past-notes list += v1.5.1-604); this PROGRESS_LOG entry; memory next. Notes carry the honest GOG "restart to see added game" caveat.

**Cut (DONE ✅):** `release.yml` `stable=true` on `gamehub-604-build` `version=1.6.0-604` → **run 26662894464** ✅ created GH Release **v1.6.0-604** (tag `v1.6.0-604`, Latest, not draft/prerelease) with the 9 full variants + 3 `.rvp`. Lite built `stable=false` on `feature/lite-variant-tier1` `version=1.6.0-604` → **run 26662895568** ✅ (artifacts only — its release job is correctly skipped; **Lite assets are MANUALLY attached, not auto-published** — confirmed this is how v1.5.1 was assembled, its Lite release job was `skipped`). 9 Lite APKs `gh release download` from run 26662895568 → `gh release upload v1.6.0-604`. **End state = 21 assets** (9 full + 9 Lite + 3 rvp), verified. (WiFi dropped mid-upload during the session; both gh upload attempts hit `no such host`, 0 partial assets landed, completed cleanly on reconnect.) Pre-release policy ([[feedback_bannerhub_prerelease]]) now resumes — all subsequent builds artifact-only until the next explicit stable.

## 2026-06-06 — 🎯 v1.0.0-607 STABLE (first 6.0.7-base release, new Latest)

First BannerHub v6 stable on the **GameHub 6.0.7** base (versionCode 118). Fresh semver line (the `-604` line ran `v1.0.0-604`→`v1.8.0-604`; the `-607` line restarts at `1.0.0`). Same keystore as the 604 line → installs in place over an existing BannerHub v6.

**Build commit:** `22280fb` (README-for-607 update) on top of `91a6220` (the Banner Tools grid fix that drops the Renderer + GPU Spoof tiles on 6.0.7). HEAD of `gamehub-607-build`.

**Headline deltas vs the 604 line:**
- **No Lite.** XiaoJi's own −46% size pass on 6.0.7 brings the full build to ~47 MB — already smaller than the old 604 Lite — so a distinct Lite strips nothing extra. Concept absorbed into every variant.
- **GPU Spoof + Legacy renderer (GLES2) dropped on 6.0.7** (pinned `compatibleWith("6.0.4")`). 6.0.7 ships a native GPU spoof; its rewritten Vulkan X-server is incompatible with the old GLES2 `libxserver.so`/`libwinemu.so` pair (device-confirmed SIGABRT). 607 Banner Tools grid = Vibration · Game ID · Audio · GOG · Overlay · Root.
- Everything else carries forward: GOG, Explore homepage + update check, preload-free PC vibration, in-game perf overlay (root), recording-compatible audio, offline component picker, synthetic-ID external-launcher support, privacy hardening.

**Stable checklist done** (per [[feedback_stable_release_checklist]]): release notes were already pre-staged in `release.yml` body for the first 607 cut (What's-new + honest tile-drop note); README updated for 607 (header → 6.0.7, Latest pointer → v1.0.0-607, What's-new rewritten, Lite section → "no Lite on 607", GPU Spoof/Legacy renderer flagged 6.0.4-only, Source/Build/versioning → 607/base-apk-607, dangling "v1.0.0-604 section" pointer fixed) — commit `22280fb`; this PROGRESS_LOG entry; memory next.

**Cut (DONE ✅):** `release.yml` `stable=true` on `gamehub-607-build` `version=1.0.0-607` → **run 27080654650** ✅ created GH Release **v1.0.0-607** (tag `v1.0.0-607`, **Latest**, not draft/prerelease) — **13 assets** = 9 full variants + `bh_explore.json` + `patches.rvp`/`patches-1.0.0.rvp`/`patches-1.0.0-sources.rvp`. No Lite assets (none on 607). Built base `base-apk-607` (GameHub_6.0.7.apk, vc118). 1.8.0-604 demoted from Latest. APK sha256 (Normal `a48aed57…`, Original `1eedda71…`, PuBG `dc33dfa2…`, PuBG-CrossFire `fd3afa09…`, AnTuTu `efe9b167…`, alt-AnTuTu `029629c6…`, Ludashi `d77f6afc…`, Genshin `690e3df9…`, Normal-GHL `e58650fc…`); sizes ~46.98–47.05 MB.

## 2026-06-06 — v1.0.0-607 release-notes "What's new" reformat (notes-only, no rebuild)

User feedback on the published release page: each What's-new subject needed to be a bold heading larger than its description, and the section was burying the Renderer/GPU-Spoof removal in a parenthetical. Reworked the `release.yml` body What's-new section: subjects are now `###` headings (🧱 Rebased / 🪶 Smaller–no-Lite / ⚠️ GPU Spoof+Legacy renderer removed / ✅ Everything else) each with a description, and a **dedicated removal subject** spelling out the why (native 6.0.7 spoof; Vulkan X-server incompatible w/ GLES2 libs → SIGABRT). Then bumped the **"What's new in <ver>" header to `##`** so it's larger than the `###` subjects. Commits `fd34d3c` + `cf6be53` on `gamehub-607-build`. Applied the SAME edits to the **already-published** v1.0.0-607 release body via `gh release edit --notes-file` (no APK rebuild; assets untouched). README's What's-new already used this structure (it's the gen_whatsnew source for the Explore card), so no README change needed.

## 2026-06-06 — PRIVACY.md updated for 6.0.7 + rolled-in Lite strips documented

User flagged PRIVACY.md was still 604. Rebranded 6.0.4/`gamehub-604-build` → 6.0.7/`gamehub-607-build`; noted the 8-channel kill table is the same patches re-fingerprinted onto 6.0.7 (commit links point at original impl). Added a **"Rolled into every build"** section documenting the two former Lite-only, privacy-relevant strips now `use=true` on every 6.0.7 variant (commit `590584f`): **Disable Aliyun NumberAuth** (carrier one-tap phone-login SDK `com.mobile.auth.gatewayauth.*` — identity+anti-tamper surface; stub `System.loadLibrary("pns-…alijtca_plus")`→no-op then delete `libpns-*-alijtca_plus.so`, ~0.5MB) + **Strip cloud gaming** (Haima HMCP/WebRTC → XiaoJi cloud servers; neutralise IjkMediaPlayer.loadLibrariesOnce + hmwebrtc DefaultLoader.load, strip 4 libs + features.cloud asset tree, ~21.5MB). Noted the 604 Lite font/AVIF strips are moot on 607 (XiaoJi did them). Softened the smali verify step (R8 letters differ per base → point at patch sources). Commit `0c89544` on `gamehub-607-build`. Mirrored to the website privacy page too (bannerhub-site `afeed93`).

## 2026-06-06 — PRIVACY.md: store-credential safety section (Steam/GOG/Epic)

User wanted a way to show users their Steam/GOG/Epic credentials are safe. VERIFIED the flows first: GOG login = GOG's own OAuth WebView (`auth.gog.com/auth?...response_type=token`, GogLoginActivity.java) — password entered on GOG's page → GOG; implicit-flow token stored ONLY in on-device `bh_gog_prefs`, used only against GOG hosts (embed/api/content-system/cdn/cloudstorage/www.gog.com); GOG token NEVER sent to workers.dev/vgabc (grep empty). Steam login = real Valve client under Wine (BannerHub no code in path). Epic = zero BannerHub Epic code. No patch rewrites any Steam/GOG/Epic host; catalog redirect only swaps the 2 landscape-api hosts. Added a "Your store logins stay between you and the store" section to PRIVACY.md (commit `2d48d7c`). NOTE/caveat for future: the Worker has a DORMANT Steam owned-games merge (`/steam/steamid/store` stores a SteamID64 in CF KV; on a library call it fetches steamcommunity.com/<id>/games?xml=1 and merges) — but the 607 client wires NO SteamID-storing patch, so it never fires; and it only ever handles the PUBLIC SteamID/owned-games, never credentials. Deliberately did NOT write a blanket "Steam never touches our API" line because of that capability; scoped the claim to credentials/passwords/tokens (which is accurate).

## 2026-06-07 — Legacy GLES2 renderer on 6.0.7: recon + binary-recovered JNI table + wrapper-shim skeleton

Investigated bringing the legacy GLES2 renderer back on the 6.0.7 base (currently pinned `compatibleWith("6.0.4")`). Three commits on `gamehub-607-build`:

- **`c27c1c2`** — `docs/LEGACY_RENDERER_607_SHIM_RECON.md`: full recon + shim spec. **Root cause** of the 607 `SIGABRT` = JNI command-surface drift. The 6.0.7 `com.winemu.core.server.XServer` grew **11→40 native methods** (added a **29-method `effects*` ReShade FX subsystem** + `setGpuPassthroughEnabled` + `stop`) AND **deleted the 2 the 6.0.2 lib registers at startup** (`setRenderingEnabled(Z)V`, `setSurfaceFormat(I)V`). The all-dynamic legacy `JNI_OnLoad`→`RegisterNatives` hits the missing `setSurfaceFormat` → `NoSuchMethodError` → ART abort (already device-captured: `…XServer.setSurfaceFormat(I)V at XServer.<clinit>` from `libxserver_legacy.so (JNI_OnLoad+128)`). Contrast 6.0.4 where the gap was a single rename — trivially shimmed. The 9 core renderer/transport/input methods (incl. `setShmPath`/`surfaceChanged`) **match name+sig** between 6.0.2 and 6.0.7, so the data-plane contract is intact.

- **`87a298e`** — Appendix A: **binary-recovered the legacy `RegisterNatives` table** from `libxserver_legacy.so` (md5 `e8eb8948…`). Method: the lib has 0 `Java_*` exports and ships packed/RELR relocs (no `R_AARCH64_RELATIVE`), so parsed the `JNINativeMethod` array directly out of `.data` (`+0x8`, **11 entries, 24-byte stride**, ending `.data+0x110`; `JNI_OnLoad`@`0x8888c`). Full table w/ names+sigs+`.text` fn-offsets: `startUI ()V@0x88944`, `start (…)Z@0x88964`, `setShmPath@0x88c10`, `surfaceChanged@0x88c7c`, `sendWindowChange@0x88cb4`, `sendMouseEvent@0x88d64`, `sendTouchEvent@0x88f58`, `sendKeyEvent@0x89070`, `sendTextEvent@0x890b4`, `setRenderingEnabled (Z)V@0x891e8` (deleted-607), `setSurfaceFormat (I)V@0x89200` (deleted-607). Locks the forward half of the 40-entry wrapper table.

- **`b03f741`** — `native/xserver_shim/` (**wrapper-shim SKELETON, compiles clean `-Wall -Wextra`, NOT device-validated**). A "translator" `libxserver.so`: `JNI_OnLoad` `dlopen`s the legacy lib, runs its `JNI_OnLoad` with the global JNI table's `RegisterNatives` slot `mprotect`-redirected to a capture hook (harvests the 11 real fn-ptrs; the 2 deleted methods are never named against the live class), then `RegisterNatives` 40 entries onto `XServer` — 9 forward (`surfaceChanged` wrapped to inject `setSurfaceFormat`), `setGpuPassthroughEnabled`→captured `setRenderingEnabled(true)` (the proven 6.0.4 force-on remap), `stop`→teardown, 29 `effects*` stubs. + CMakeLists (builds as `libxserver.so`, arm64) + README w/ build + device-tuning TODOs.

**Static half is fully spec'd + drafted.** Remaining = device-only: (1) `DEFAULT_SURFACE_FORMAT` value, (2) does the GLES2 engine actually composite under 6.0.7's single-process model, (3) `libwinemu`/`DirectRendering` fallback if not, (4) `mprotect`-JNI-table sanity on a CheckJNI/debuggable build. NEXT to move from skeleton → testable: wire the wrapper into the renderer patch (un-pin from 6.0.4, point `loadXserver` at the wrapper, bundle the renamed legacy pair), artifact build, flash, read `/proc/<pid>/maps` + tombstone. Memory: [[project_bannerhub_revanced_legacy_gles2_renderer]].

## 2026-06-07 — In-game Steam friends/chat overlay (pre1 → pre13, branch `feature/steam-chat-overlay`)

New feature on top of the 6.0.8 docs commit (`2fead4a`): a Banner-owned, classic-View **Steam friends/chat overlay** drawn over the Wine game surface — the same `WindowManager` pill + slide-out-panel technique as `BhPerfOverlay`, gated by a Banner Tools → Steam Chat master toggle. Hooked from `WineActivity.onResume → attach` / `onDestroy → detach`. Files all under `extensions/gamehub/src/main/java/com/xj/winemu/steamchat/`: `BhSteamChatOverlay.java` (UI), `BhSteamBridge.java` (in-process Steam client bridge), `BhSteamChatController.java` (enable gate), `BhSteamChatMenus.java`. The ReVanced patch is **"In-game Steam chat overlay"** (applies clean on 6.0.8, all 9 variants).

**The hard part was the bridge, not the UI.** GameHub's Steam client (`SteamBridgeClient`) is Koin-registered and R8-obfuscated, reached via coroutines. `BhSteamBridge` resolves it by **scanning Koin's instance-registry reflectively**, matching `Koin.get` by the kept `Qualifier` param, and is hardened against the obfuscation/coroutine surface. Request/response verbs: `friends.list`, `friends.message_history`, `friends.send_message`; live push via the `steam:chat-message` Flow (`listen`/`unlisten`). The panel surfaces the exact bridge-resolve failure step on the UI when it can't resolve (so device debugging is self-describing).

Iteration arc (one commit ≈ one "pre" build):
- **pre1** `c028213` — read-only friends/chat overlay prototype.
- **pre2** `b3049f1` — surface bridge-resolve failure step on the panel.
- **pre3** `9ffc560` — obfuscation-proof the Koin/coroutine reflection.
- **pre4** `cfbafa9` — match `Koin.get` by kept `Qualifier` param + dump types on miss.
- **pre5** `64b64fb` — resolve `SteamBridgeClient` via Koin instance-registry scan (resolution working).
- **pre6** `e91d022` — show plain "In-Game" when `gameName` is JSON-null (org.json `optString` returns literal "null" for `JSONObject.NULL` — guard explicitly).
- **pre7** `78749e2` — reply from the overlay (`friends.send_message`).
- **pre8** `e85416a` — group friends online-first + collapsible Offline section.
- **pre9** `21530ea` — make the overlay window focusable while open (toggle `FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE` on `updateViewLayout`) so the composer `EditText` accepts text; collapse hands input back to the game.
- **pre10** `784f245` — send works (`clientMessageId` MUST be a **String** — kotlinx rejects a number and the send silently fails) + render inline chat images (BBCode `[img …steamusercontent…]` → async bitmap, tap → full-res in browser).
- **pre11** `274fec2` — live incoming messages via the `steam:chat-message` Flow (subscribe on expand; reload the open thread when a message for it arrives). **Device-tested (screenshots).**
- **pre12** `a174167` — **pin "‹ Back to friends" above the scroll.** It was child 0 of `listCol` *inside* the dp(320) ScrollView, so it scrolled away in an active conversation (user had to scroll to top to find it). Moved it to a dedicated `backRow` TextView in the panel's **fixed zone** (between `status` and the ScrollView); `loadHistory` shows it, `loadFriends` hides it. Build run `27107526666` ✅ (artifacts-only, version `1.1.0-608-pre12`).
- **pre13** `7f8a432` — **aligned, sender-tinted chat bubbles** (who-said-what). New `bubbleRow(fromMe, content)` helper wraps each message: incoming = dark bubble (`#2A2E38`) left-aligned, outgoing = Steam-blue bubble (`#24506E`) right-aligned. Dropped the old `"You: "` prefix + dim-gray treatment; alignment + colour now carry attribution. Text capped `maxWidth dp(200)` so long lines wrap inside the bubble. **Images** wrapped in the same aligned/tinted bubble (previously an incoming vs outgoing image was identical). Live-incoming + refresh re-render through the same path so they get bubbles too. Build run `27107670536` ✅, "In-game Steam chat overlay" succeeded on all 9 variants, no SEVERE.
- **pre14** `ed6de7e` — **fix bubble direction (was all-left).** Device showed every bubble left/dark: pre13's `fromMe` read invented keys (`fromLocalUser`/`isOutgoing`) → always false. Pulled the **authoritative schema from the 6.0.8 decompile** (`SteamChatMessageDto`, `~/gamehub-6.0.8-jadx`): 16 fields incl. **`direction`** enum `mli` = `"Incoming"`/`"Outgoing"` — the ONLY reliable sender signal (`friendSteamId` is the conversation *peer* on both sides, so it can't tell direction; a sender-id heuristic would've failed). Fix: `fromMe = "Outgoing".equalsIgnoreCase(direction)`. Also switched display text to **`plainMessage`** (the native UI's clean text) and image detection to **`rawMessage`** (carries BBCode `[img …]`). Build run `27107992511` ✅. **DEVICE-CONFIRMED** (screenshot `Screenshot_20260607-193009.png`): outgoing right/blue, incoming left/dark.
- **pre15** `5722163` — **grouped name + timestamp headers (native-style).** New `senderHeader(who, ts, fromMe)` line shown once per sender run (groups consecutive messages like GameHub's native chat): friend `displayName` (blue) left / "You" (green) right, with the time. Timestamp = the `timestamp` field, an **unsigned-32 Unix-epoch-seconds UInt** (`fwk` value class masks `& 0xFFFFFFFF`); `formatTime()` × 1000 → `android.text.format.DateFormat.getTimeFormat(act)` (device 12/24h). Build run `27108156680` ✅, all 9 variants, no SEVERE. **DEVICE-CONFIRMED** (screenshot `Screenshot_20260607-193905.png`).
- **pre16** `72b94f9` — **avatars + unread badges + send-state labels** (everything except friend search). (1) **Avatars** (`avatarUrl`): circular lazy-loaded `circleAvatar` — on friend rows via `avatarWithPresence` (34dp avatar with the online/in-game/offline dot overlaid bottom-right, replacing the old standalone dot), and a 18dp avatar in each conversation `senderHeader` on the speaker's outer edge. (2) **Unread badges**: friends-list rows show a count pill — pulled from a NEW `friends.conversation_summaries` fetch in `loadFriends` (`SteamFriendDto` has no unread field; `SteamConversationSummaryDto.unreadCount` keyed by `friendSteamId`, bare-array response) → `parseUnread` map → `unreadBadge`. (3) **Send state** (`sendState` enum = Sending/Sent/Failed, case-insensitive incl. lowercase `pending`): right-aligned `sendStatusLabel` under our own messages — "Sending…" (gray) / "Failed to send" (red `#E05B5B`); final "Sent" shows nothing. Build run `27108447115` ✅, all 9 variants, no SEVERE. **DEVICE-CONFIRMED** (screenshots `Screenshot_20260607-195038.png` friends list w/ avatars+presence, `…-195048.png` conversation): outgoing avatar correctly shows the local user (`avatarUrl` IS sender-specific — incoming=friend / outgoing=me), names+times+bubbles all native-like.

- **pre17** `6145bf5` — **mark conversation read on open** (clears the unread badge). On `loadHistory`, after rendering, fire `friends.mark_conversation_read`. `MarkConversationReadRequest` (`uoc`) takes **two** longs — `steamId` (self) + `friendSteamId` (peer); `friendSteamId` being a distinct field means `steamId` is the *local user*. Resolve our own SteamID64 once via **`auth.bootstrap_snapshot`** → `extractSteamId64` (regex `"steamId":"?(7656\d{13})"?`, accepts numeric or quoted), cached in `localSteamId`; fall back to the peer id for self if unresolved. Also drop the friend from the local `unreadByFriend` map for instant feedback (authoritative clear comes from the server's next `conversation_summaries`). Build run `27108720589` ✅, all 9 variants, no SEVERE. *Verify on device:* badge clears and stays cleared after returning to the list / refresh (confirms the server-side mark + the steamId=self assumption).

- **pre18** `47c9bd2` — **Banner Tools cleanup + pill UX.** (1) **Removed the standalone "Steam Chat" tile** (TILE_LABELS/TILE_DRAWABLES/dispatch case 6 dropped; `bh_bt_steam_chat` drawable now unreferenced/harmless; `BhSteamChatMenus` now dead code, left in place). (2) **Ungated the "Overlay" tile** — opens for everyone (dropped the tile-level `isRootGranted` grey-out + Root-redirect). (3) **`BhPerfMenus.showOverlayToggleDialog` now hosts TWO toggles** (retitled "In-game Overlays"): **Steam Chat overlay** (no root) + **Performance overlay** which is now **root-gated in-place** (checkbox disabled @50% alpha + "⚠ Requires root — tap to grant" → `showRootDialog` when not rooted). So Steam chat is no longer accidentally behind root. (4) **Steam chat pill moved to the right edge** (`Gravity.TOP|END`, corner radii flipped to round the inner edge) like the ⚡ perf pill, **made draggable** (new `PillTouch`: vertical drag persists `pill_y`, tap still expands), and got a **pill-opacity slider** (`buildOpacityRow`, 5–100%, live preview, full-opacity while open) — mirroring the perf overlay. New `BhSteamChatController` keys `pill_y` + `pill_opacity` (+`PILL_OPACITY_MIN/DEFAULT`). Build run `27109287550` ✅ (Banner Tools drawables/menu-row + Steam chat overlay all succeeded), no SEVERE. **DEVICE-CONFIRMED** (screenshots `Screenshot_20260607-202847.png` combined "In-game Overlays" dialog w/ both toggles, `…-202923.png` chat panel anchored right edge w/ "Pill opacity — 48%" slider + both pills on the right). Perf toggle enabled = device rooted (correct gating).

## 2026-06-08 — 🏁 STABLE SHIPPED `v1.1.0-608` (Latest)

Cut from `gamehub-608-build` (`a0b40e3`) via `release.yml` `workflow_dispatch` version `1.1.0-608` `stable=true` → **run `27109930201` ✅** (all 9 variants patched, "In-game Steam chat overlay" + Banner Tools all succeeded, no SEVERE). GitHub Release **`v1.1.0-608`** ("BannerHub v6 1.1.0-608", prerelease=false, **marked Latest**, supersedes `v1.0.0-608`): 13 assets = 9 APKs + `bh_explore.json` + 3 `.rvp`. Stable-keystore Normal apk md5 **`8e433ff7efdcae0562e0289dd35dfe39`** (installs in place over prior stables — same pkg `banner.hub` + same stable keystore). Headline of this release = the in-game Steam friends/chat overlay (pre1→pre18 arc above) + the Banner Tools "In-game Overlays" consolidation. URL: https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub-revanced/releases/tag/v1.1.0-608

NEXT: update bannerhub-site v6 page (Latest + 1.1.0-608 changelog) — don't push site until user go; optional future polish = friend search / typing indicator (`friends.send_typing`) / stickers.

### 2026-06-08 — Fix stale "What's New" on the v1.1.0-608 release (shipped 1.0.0-608's notes)

The cut v1.1.0-608 release showed the **1.0.0-608** What's New (the "Rebased onto GameHub 6.0.8 / 41 patches" rebase notes) with **zero mention of the Steam chat overlay** — three sources were never advanced past 1.0.0-608: (1) the hardcoded `## What's new` block in `release.yml`'s release body, (2) the README `## What's new in v1.0.0-608` section (which feeds the in-app Explore card via `gen_whatsnew.py`), and (3) therefore the baked + asset `bh_explore.json`. Fixed all (commit `e42e148` on `gamehub-608-build`): rewrote the What's-New in **release.yml** (future cuts) + **README** (new `## What's new in v1.1.0-608` — headline 💬 Steam chat overlay + 🧹 In-game Overlays consolidation; old release notes pushed to the carryover/past-release framing), regenerated **explore/bh_explore.json** via `gen_whatsnew.py` (hero now "WHAT'S NEW IN v1.1.0-608 • In-game Steam friends & chat overlay • Banner Tools: one In-game Overlays menu"). GitHub-side (no rebuild): **edited the published `v1.1.0-608` release body** in place (`gh release edit`, surgically replaced only the What's-New section) + **re-uploaded the live `bh_explore.json` asset** with the hero body swapped (kept its correct build-time `version=1.1.0-608`/`build=608010100` stamp) so the in-app Explore "What's New" refreshes live via `releases/latest/download/bh_explore.json`. Verified live both. CAVEAT: the `bh_explore.json` **baked into the shipped 1.1.0-608 APKs** (offline fallback) still carries the stale hero — the live override supersedes it online; only a rebuild would fix the offline copy (not warranted). ROOT CAUSE = the `## What's new` text is curated/hardcoded per release in BOTH release.yml and README and wasn't bumped when 1.1.0-608 was cut; for next stable, update those two BEFORE cutting.

**RE-CUT to fix the offline copy (2026-06-08):** at user's request, re-ran the stable workflow (`gamehub-608-build` `92cb583`, version `1.1.0-608`, `stable=true`) → **run `27110532975` ✅** (CI `gen_whatsnew` regenerated hero for v1.1.0-608, all 9 patched, no SEVERE). `action-gh-release` **replaced all 13 assets in place** on the existing `v1.1.0-608` release (still Latest, prerelease=false); body re-applied from the now-correct release.yml template (still mentions Steam chat). Verified the **baked `assets/bh_explore.json` inside the new APK** now reads "WHAT'S NEW IN v1.1.0-608 • In-game Steam friends & chat overlay …" — offline copy fixed. **New stable-keystore Normal apk md5 = `3f0a27ee39c33d1fb74f80989dfdd9e9`** (was `8e433ff7…`; md5 churn expected from rebuild, installs in place). Delivered to `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.1.0-608-Normal.apk`.

## 2026-06-10 — README download badges → self-hosted shields endpoint JSON (kills "token pool" outage)

The README's two download badges (total + latest-release) used shields.io's GitHub-integration endpoints, which render from shields' **shared GitHub token pool** — on 2026-06-10 both showed "UNABLE TO SELECT NEXT GITHUB TOKEN FROM POOL" instead of numbers (server-side shields outage, intermittent; latest-release recovered first, total stayed broken longer). Replaced with **shields `/endpoint` badges backed by repo-hosted JSON**: a new scheduled workflow `.github/workflows/update-badges.yml` (cron hourly (was 6h, commit `7228941`; bumped same day) + `workflow_dispatch` + `release: published`) computes the counts itself via `gh api` with the repo's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` (paginated sum of `assets[].download_count` over all releases, plus `releases/latest`), shields-style-formats them (2908→2.9k, 46356→46k), writes `.github/badges/downloads-total.json` + `downloads-latest.json` (schemaVersion 1, label/color/namedLogo preserved: Downloads/blue + Latest Release/brightgreen, github logo, cacheSeconds 3600), and commits as The412Banner only when changed. The release-event path pins checkout/push to `gamehub-608-build` (release events check out the tag). README badge `img.shields.io/github/downloads/...` URLs → `img.shields.io/endpoint?url=<raw.githubusercontent.com .../gamehub-608-build/.github/badges/*.json>&style=for-the-badge`; same look, but shields now only fetches static raw JSON — the GitHub-token-pool failure mode is structurally gone (data freshness = cron interval, hourly). Seeded initial JSON with live counts (total 46,356 → "46k"; latest 2,908 → "2.9k"). Drive-by README fixes in the same commit: header "Latest stable" link was stale at v1.0.0-608 → **v1.2.0-608** (current Latest), and the line-47 `#whats-new-in-v100-608` anchor pointed at a heading that no longer exists → `#whats-new-in-v120-608`.

## 2026-06-10 — Steam chat v2: invite cards + typing + stickers (branch `feature/steam-chat-v2`, IN PROGRESS)

User-reported bug (screenshots 16:46): game invites render as **empty bubbles** in the overlay while the native Steam Friends screen shows a rich L4D2 card. Root cause: invites are BBCode-only messages — `rawMessage` = `[gameinvite appid=…]` (family: `gameinvite|lobbyinvite|lobbyinviteconnectstring|remoteplaytogetherinvite|playtestinvite|broadcastinvite|broadcastviewrequest|tradeoffer|inviteurl|invite`, per GameHub's parser `kgj.java`) with **empty `plainMessage`**, and our renderer only knew text/images.

Shipped in commit `0f73d5f` (all in `BhSteamChatOverlay.java`, +451/−22):
- **Invite cards**: parse invite BBCode → card with header art (`cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/{appid}/header.jpg`), verb line per kind ("X invited you to play / to playtest / to Remote Play / sent you a trade offer"), game name resolved via **`apps.app_details`** `{"appId":N}` → `AppDetailsDto.localizedNames` (session-cached `sAppInfo`), and live/Expired state = friend's **`SteamFriendDto.gameAppId == appid && isInGame`** from cached friends.list (native card's rule; DTO also has `gameLobbyId`/`connectString`/`isJoinableGame`). No Join action (game already fullscreen) — live shows "Active now — join from GameHub's Steam chat".
- **Typing**: new `steam:chat-typing` listener (payload `{friendSteamId}` per `SteamChatTypingDto`) → status line "X is typing…" with 15s lapse; composer `TextWatcher` sends `friends.send_typing` `{"steamId":peer}` throttled to 1/10s.
- **Stickers/emoticons**: `[sticker type=…]` renders 92dp from `community.fastly.steamstatic.com/economy/sticker/{name}` (same CDN+size as native, kgj:1523); emoticon-only messages render as 28dp images from `…/economy/emoticon/{name}` (kgj:764); mixed text shows `:name:`. Composer ☺ button → lazy sticker strip from `friends.chat_stickers` (DTO: name/imageUrl/staticImageUrl/appId/useCount/…), tap sends `friends.send_sticker` `{steamId, stickerName, clientMessageId:String}`.
- **Voice chat investigated — NOT feasible**: libsteamkit_core's full RPC dispatch table (strings in .so) has ZERO voice topics (`friends::*`/`apps::*`/`session::*`/`friend_invite::*` only); `JoinVoice`/`LeaveVoice` strings are just compiled-in protobuf descriptors. Native lib also exposes `friends::chat_emoticons` (no Java caller — usable via our bridge anyway).

Verify build dispatched: run **27306720963** (`build_pull_request.yml` workflow_dispatch on the branch) — **result pending** (user lost wifi; PAUSED here). NEXT: check run, then device-test (invite card in frostyiceboi thread, typing both ways, sticker send/receive), then merge to `gamehub-608-build` + release notes.

Prerelease APK run **`27309885535`** ✅ (release.yml dispatch on `feature/steam-chat-v2`, version `1.3.0-608-pre1`, stable=false → artifacts only): all 9 variants patched, "In-game Steam chat overlay" succeeded, **no SEVERE**.

## 2026-06-10 — Steam chat v2 pre2: emoji/emoticon picker, send image, auto-scroll, smooth refresh, collapsible opacity

Device feedback on pre1 (sticker button "none available", typing dead, "refreshing conversation" jank on incoming, no auto-scroll, invite card rendered-but-expired) + new asks (emoji options + Send image; collapsible opacity arrow). Commit `3d93fc3` on `feature/steam-chat-v2`:
- **Picker rework** (`BhSteamChatOverlay.addComposer`): ☺ now opens a 3-tab picker. **Emoji** (Unicode array, always available — fixes the dead "none available"; tap inserts at caret). **Steam** emoticons from `friends.chat_emoticons` (field `token` → insert `:token:`). **Stickers** fixed: `SteamChatStickerDto` has NO `name` field (decompile-confirmed: only imageUrl/staticImageUrl/appId/useCount/timeLastUsed/timeReceived) — old loop skipped every entry; now derive sticker name from CDN url (`…/economy/sticker/<appid>/<name>/…`) + honest "purchased items" empty-state.
- **Send image**: new transparent `BhSteamImagePickerActivity` (ACTION_GET_CONTENT → base64 → `friends.upload_chat_image` {steamId,fileName,mimeType,bytesBase64}, 8MB cap). Registered by new `steamChatImagePickerManifestPatch` (exported=false), wired via `dependsOn` from `steamChatOverlayPatch`. 🖼 button in composer.
- **Auto-scroll** to newest on open/send/incoming (`scrollToBottom`, ScrollView promoted to field).
- **Smooth incoming**: live `steam:chat-message` → `loadHistory(...,silent=true)` — no "Loading…" flash, preserves composer draft+focus, scoped per-conversation (cleared on friend switch / back).
- **Collapsible opacity**: slider now behind a `▸/▾ Pill opacity — N%` arrow header, collapsed by default.
- **Typing**: wiring verified correct end-to-end (topic `steam:chat-typing`, field `friendSteamId`, send `{steamId}` — all decompile-confirmed); left unchanged. Native only emits when the peer actively types in a real Steam client — needs a 2-person test. Add bridge logging if still dead.

Verify build (`build_pull_request.yml`) run **27312390673** ✅ green (patches+extension compile). Prerelease APK run **27312471850** ✅ (release.yml, version `1.3.0-608-pre2`, stable=false → artifacts only), all 9 variants, **no SEVERE**. Delivered: `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-pre2-Normal.apk` md5 **`65eb4600803ae4259c1083cc6e89e3e9`**. Test: emoji insert, emoticon insert, send image, smooth incoming + auto-scroll, collapsible opacity arrow, typing (have friend type on desktop Steam).

**Voice chat**: Steam voice NOT bridgeable (libsteamkit_core has zero voice RPC topics — re-confirmed). Presented 3 options; user chose **B/C = in-overlay WebRTC** (B = Cloudflare Realtime TURN+SFU + DO signaling; C = WebRTC signalled over Steam chat, STUN/TURN only). NEXT: scope WebRTC voice (mic capture + audio focus vs game + Cloudflare Realtime), likely on a new branch after pre2 device-test.

## 2026-06-10 — Steam chat v2 pre3: image-upload JPEG re-encode + panel/opacity on-screen fit

pre2 device test (screenshots): emoji ✅, auto-scroll ✅, typing untested (friend's own msgs weren't sending Steam-side), image send FAILED (`native: Failure(ug): begin steam chat image upload failed with status…`), opacity slider cut off bottom of screen when expanded. Commit `60bba9e`:
- **Image upload fix** (`BhSteamImagePickerActivity`): the native "begin upload" rejected the SOURCE image (our payload was correct — it reached the native stage). Now `encodeJpeg(uri)` decodes + downscales to ≤2048px long edge + re-compresses JPEG q90 (raw-bytes fallback) so HEIC/WebP/oversized picks become a clean sized JPEG; fileName→*.jpg, mime→image/jpeg. Failures now show the FULL native error in an AlertDialog (toast clipped the status code).
- **Panel/opacity on-screen fit** (`BhSteamChatOverlay`): message ScrollView height capped to `screenH - dp(210)` (clamped 140..320); new `fitPanelOnScreen()` measures `container` post-layout and nudges `lp.y` up so panel bottom ≤ screenH — called on expand + opacity-expand. Fixes the opacity slider running off the bottom regardless of dragged pill Y.

Verify run `27313696999` ✅; prerelease APK run `27313748361` ✅ (all 9, no SEVERE). Delivered **Genshin** variant (per new rule [[feedback_deliver_genshin_variant]]): `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-pre3-Genshin.apk` md5 **`c6f8f787834542397a406c2aca1db721`**. Test: send image (gallery pick → should post as JPEG; if it still fails, screenshot the full dialog error), opacity expand near bottom of screen.

## 2026-06-10 — Steam chat v2 pre4: image send via Cloudflare R2 (bypass 401 native upload)

pre3 device test surfaced the real image-upload cause: `friends.upload_chat_image` → `native Failure(ug): begin steam chat image upload failed with status 401 Unauthorized`. It's an AUTH failure (Steam web access-token expiry, ~24h, GameHub may hold no refresh token), NOT format/size — our payload was correct, and the app's OWN image button hits the same 401. Opacity-cutoff fix from pre3 CONFIRMED working.

**Fix = host the image ourselves + send the URL via the working chat path** (user chose Cloudflare R2; see [[reference_steam_chat_image_upload_401]]):
- **Worker** (`bannerhub-api` commit `dc05557`, master+main): added `POST /chat/upload-image` (→ R2 bucket `bannerhub-chat-images`, x-bh-chat gate + 5MB/image-only caps) and `GET /chat/i/<key>` (serves it). R2 binding `CHAT_IMAGES` added; deployed via CF REST (`PUT …/scripts/bannerhub-api`, metadata bindings = KV TOKEN_STORE + R2 + keep_bindings secret_text). Bucket created + **7-day lifecycle** (Age 604800s). Verified live: bindings 4/4 intact, existing getAllComponentList still 200 (no disruption), upload→serve round-trip 200, no-key→403. Worker at `bannerhub-api.the412banner.workers.dev`.
- **Extension** (`a8a1d24`): `BhSteamImagePickerActivity` now pick → `encodeJpeg` → `uploadToHost` (POST worker, x-bh-chat header) → `friends.send_message(url)`. Dropped native upload_chat_image entirely. Overlay `extractImageUrl` now matches bare image-extension URLs (incl. `/chat/i/`) via `IMG_URL_RE` so our side renders sent images inline.

Test: 🖼 → pick gallery image → should host + post as inline image both sides (failure dialog now names the failing stage: host vs chat send).

## 2026-06-10 — Steam chat v2 pre5: WebRTC 1:1 voice call (Option C, spike) on feature/steam-chat-v2

User: "start voice as part of chat v2." Built Option C (WebRTC 1:1, signalled over Steam chat). Commit `2f7b2d5`:
- **Architecture pivot**: WebView-hosted WebRTC, NOT a bundled native lib (injecting libwebrtc.so into a patched APK is fragile). Android System WebView ships Chromium WebRTC → run getUserMedia + RTCPeerConnection in a headless WebView.
- **`BhVoiceController`** (new): hosts the WebView + embedded HTML/JS page (audio-only peer, symmetric caller/callee), `@JavascriptInterface BhVoice` bridge (signal/state/log). `SIG_PREFIX` = zero-width-marked hidden chat messages carry base64 SDP/ICE.
- **Overlay integration**: chat-message listener intercepts Incoming SIG_PREFIX messages → `handleVoiceSignal` (routes to call / raises incoming-call prompt for offers); renderHistory skips signal messages; 🎙 composer button → `startVoiceCall`; voiceBar in panel fixed zone (Calling/Connecting/In-call + Mute/Hang up; incoming = Accept/Decline); RECORD_AUDIO via `ensureMicPermission`; detach hangs up. Controller implements `BhVoiceController.Host` (sendVoiceSignal→hidden send_message, onVoiceState→voiceBar).
- **`steamChatVoiceManifestPatch`** (new): adds RECORD_AUDIO + MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS; wired into `steamChatOverlayPatch` dependsOn.
- **STUN-only** spike (public Google STUN hardcoded in the page). Cloudflare TURN deferred — token got Authentication error on `/calls` API (Realtime needs dashboard enable, like R2 did). `/voice/turn` worker endpoint = task #6 pending.

Verify run `27315718747` ✅; prerelease APK run `27315788919` ✅ (all 9, no SEVERE).

## ⏸ 2026-06-10 — PAUSED / RESUME POINT (awaiting a 2-device voice tester)

**Branch `feature/steam-chat-v2`** (code tip `2f7b2d5`, log tip this commit). Current build **`1.3.0-608-pre5`** Genshin md5 `ee90205c7240729ee90e6465e765cd07` on device.

BLOCKED ON: 2-device voice test (user finding a 2nd person — both must run pre5). Test = open each other → 🎙 → Accept → talk; report connects+audio / stuck-Connecting / silent / game-audio-over-call.

Device-CONFIRMED (pre2–pre4): emoji, auto-scroll, opacity, send-image via R2. UNVERIFIED: voice (2 devices), typing (needs a friend whose msgs send).

NEXT (keyed to test outcome): stuck-connecting → enable Cloudflare Realtime + add `/voice/turn` TURN endpoint (worker; `/calls` API 401s til enabled); silent → attach WebView 1px; game-audio-over-call → audio-focus/ducking. THEN merge `feature/steam-chat-v2` → `gamehub-608-build` + What's New in release.yml+README BEFORE cutting → cut stable `v1.3.0-608` (current Latest = v1.2.0-608).

Build/deliver: `gh workflow run release.yml --ref feature/steam-chat-v2 -f version=1.3.0-608-preN -f stable=false` → `gh run download <id> -n apk-Genshin` → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/...-Genshin.apk`. Infra LIVE: R2 `bannerhub-chat-images` (7d) + worker routes `/chat/upload-image`,`/chat/i/<key>`. Worker deploy = fetch + redeploy from pushed HEAD (avoid the imagefs split-brain logged above).

## chat v2 pre6 (`6ddf142`, 2026-06-13) — voice mic-hang FIX

**2-device voice test of pre5 (2026-06-13) FAILED → root-caused.** Caller stuck on "Calling…", callee got NO incoming indicator, both directions, cross-network. Logcat (`/sdcard/Download/voicetest-pre5-logcat.txt`, app pid 12582): overlay attached + bridge ok + listening on `steam:chat-message` ✅; WebView chromium 113 + Adreno renderer started ✅; but **zero `voicejs:` lines** and no `st('failed','mic…')` → the JS `init()` **hung at `await getUserMedia`** (neither resolved nor rejected). Renderer processes repeatedly spawned + killed (`isolated not needed` / lowmemorykiller).

**Root cause:** the voice `WebView` was created with `new WebView(act)` but **never attached to a window** (headless). Chromium backgrounds a detached page, so `getUserMedia` never resolves → `createOffer()` never runs → no `{t:"offer"}` is ever sent → caller sits on "Calling…" (that label is set *before* the offer, so it proves nothing), callee never signalled. NOT the TURN/NAT risk — the call never reached ICE.

**Fix (`BhVoiceController.java`):**
- `attachHeadless()` — add the WebView to the window as a **1×1 transparent, non-interactive `TYPE_APPLICATION_PANEL`** (flags NOT_FOCUSABLE|NOT_TOUCHABLE|NOT_TOUCH_MODAL, `PixelFormat.TRANSLUCENT`), the same WindowManager technique the chat overlay uses; removed again in `cleanup()` (tracked by `webAttached`). Foreground page lets mic capture resolve.
- JS `init()` races `getUserMedia` against an **8s timeout** (`Promise.race([gum(),tmo(8000)])`) so a future hang surfaces as "Call ended: mic timeout" instead of an infinite "Calling…"; added a `log('init')` marker (expect a `voicejs: init` line next test).

Build run **27476405168** ✅ success, SEVERE-check clean. Genshin APK md5 **`01772d298c63a9677ac28c9208eeee7e`** → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-pre6-Genshin.apk`. ⚠️ BOTH devices must be on pre6. NEXT: re-run the 2-device call — expect `voicejs: init` → `voicejs: pc …` → offer sent → callee rings; if it reaches "Connecting…" then fails cross-network, that's the STUN-only/TURN gap (enable CF Realtime → `/voice/turn`).

---

## chat v2 pre7 (`e0c95d4`, 2026-06-13) — voice moved to hosted Cloudflare room

After the 2-browser test of the hosted worker room passed (live audio across two networks), the in-app client was rewritten to use it. Steam chat is no longer in the voice path at all.

- **BhVoiceController** now just attaches the 1×1 WebView and `loadUrl`s `https://bannerhub-api.the412banner.workers.dev/voice/room?room=&self=&peer=` (real origin → mic opens). Dropped `loadDataWithBaseURL`, the embedded `page()`, `SIG_PREFIX`/`b64`/`unb64`, `onSignal`, `remoteHangup`. `Host` trimmed to `onVoiceState`; the `BhVoice` JS bridge only relays `state`/`log`.
- **BhSteamChatOverlay**: 🎙 → `startVoiceCall` resolves self SteamID, rings the callee via the lobby inbox (`POST /voice/signal room=lobby payload={t:ring,room,from,name,ts}`), then opens its own room WebView. A 3s background poll of `/voice/poll?room=lobby&self=<self>` (dedicated daemon thread, started in attach / stopped in detach) surfaces incoming rings → Accept/Decline bar. `pairRoom` = sorted SteamID pair. Removed the chat-message SIG_PREFIX interception, `handleVoiceSignal`, `sendVoiceSignal`/`sendSignalTo`. Small `HttpURLConnection` GET/POST helpers.

Build run **27477313940** ✅ (compiles clean), SEVERE-clean. Genshin APK md5 **`c8f1ff2bd24c722ca40f1f47ff402afa`** → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-pre7-Genshin.apk`. Both devices need pre7. Expect logcat `voicejs: voice page init…` then `voicejs: pc connected`. NEXT: 2-device retest; then the richer floating call window (state + participant list) the user asked for.

## 2026-06-13 — chat v2 pre8: browser fallback for stale System WebView + ring logging

pre7 2-device voice test FAILED and was root-caused. Logcat showed `voicejs: voice page init … caller=true` firing (the hosted page loads from the real origin fine) but `getUserMedia` hung the full 8s → "Call ended: mic Error: timeout"; the `WebView.destroy()` 10s later was just our teardown after the timeout. Ruled out memory (lowmemorykiller was *ignoring* pressure, 11.4/15.6 GB free, renderer not killed) and RECORD_AUDIO (granted at OS level; `onPermissionRequest` auto-grants).

**Root cause: the device's active System WebView is `com.android.webview` 113.0.5672.136 (mid-2023), frozen on the AYANEO `/product` partition (not the Play-updatable one).** Embedded WebRTC `getUserMedia` hangs on that build, while the same device's Chrome 149 works — which is exactly why the earlier 2-browser test passed. Asymmetry: when the peer (newer WebView) calls, their mic opens and they send the offer, but this device can never answer because *its* mic never opens, so the peer sits on "Connecting…".

Fix (user chose to both confirm device-side and ship an app-side fallback):

- **BhVoiceController**: `webViewMajor()` reads `WebView.getCurrentWebViewPackage()`. If the major version is below `MIN_WEBVIEW_MAJOR = 120`, skip the embedded WebView entirely and `openInBrowser()` — an `ACTION_VIEW` intent to the same `/voice/room` URL, which runs in the device browser (Chrome 149) where the mic works. Backstop: if the embedded path still reports `state("failed", "…mic…")`, auto-escalate to the browser once (`fellBackToBrowser`). New host state `"external"`.
- **BhSteamChatOverlay**: handle the `"external"` state (null the call, hide the bar, toast that the call opened in the browser). Added logging to the previously-silent ring path: `voice: lobby poll started` / `… self resolved=` / `… got N signal(s)` / `incoming ring from=` / `ignoring stale ring` / `postRing …`, so incoming-ring delivery is finally diagnosable.

Build run **27477856774** ✅, SEVERE-clean. Genshin APK md5 **`647a930fa1a6d3aa0f34a76869b52905`** → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-pre8-Genshin.apk`. Both devices need pre8. With pre8 the call works regardless of WebView age (old WebView → opens in the browser automatically). Optional: sideload Android System WebView ≥120 + select it in Developer options → WebView implementation to keep calls in-app/embedded. NEXT 2-device retest: confirm the ring logs show the incoming call reaching this device, and that audio connects both ways.

## 2026-06-16 — chat v2 pre9: standalone movable voice call box (user UX rework)

User-requested rework of what happens after the 🎙 button. Previously 🎙 immediately rang the callee and showed an in-panel `voiceBar`. Now 🎙 opens a **separate, draggable call window** that is independent of the chat panel, so a call (and an incoming-call prompt) surfaces over the game even when the chat pill is collapsed.

**New `BhVoiceCallBox.java`** — its own `WindowManager` overlay (`TYPE_APPLICATION_PANEL`, `FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE | FLAG_NOT_TOUCH_MODAL`, drag the whole box by its header). Renders one of five states and reports button taps via an `Actions` interface:

- **outgoing idle** ("Call {peer}?") — **Close** · **Call**
- **outgoing ringing** ("Calling {peer}…") — **Cancel**
- **incoming** ("{peer} is calling…") — **Ignore** · **Answer**
- **connecting** ("Connecting…") — **Hang up**
- **connected** (🟢, lists `● You` / `● {peer}` + a running `Chronometer`) — **Mute** · **Hang up**

**`BhSteamChatOverlay`** — `Controller` now also `implements BhVoiceCallBox.Actions`. 🎙 → `startVoiceCall` just opens the box in outgoing-idle (no ring yet); **Call** (`onPlaceCall`) sends the lobby ring + opens the room WebView; an incoming ring pops the box in its incoming state; **Answer** (`onAnswer`) → connecting + opens the room; **Ignore** (`onDecline`) → `{t:"bye"}` + close. The timer starts on the real WebRTC `in-call` event (not on Answer) and is guarded so a later `connecting`/`calling` (e.g. ICE restart) can't wipe it (`callConnected` flag). `Mute` toggles via the existing `BhVoiceController.setMuted`. Close/Cancel/Hang up all route to `endCall` (hangup if a call exists → posts bye → close box). The old in-panel `voiceBar` and its `showVoiceBar`/`showIncomingCall`/`hideVoiceBar`/`pillButton` helpers + `voiceBar`/`voiceText` fields were removed. The WebView-too-old (<120) → browser-fallback path still closes the box and toasts.

Commit `0169a03` (The412Banner, no Claude trailer). Build run **27607924195** ✅ success, SEVERE-clean. Genshin APK md5 **`1c4ed810e6c7e3b45cc9fec668976919`** → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-pre9-Genshin.apk`. Both devices need pre9. NEXT 2-device retest: 🎙 → box (Close/Call) → Call → peer's box rings (Answer/Ignore) → Answer → both flip to Connected with a running timer + both names; verify Ignore/Cancel/Hang up/Close all tear down cleanly. Known edge: cancelling in the split-second after Call but before the WebRTC layer is created leaves the callee's incoming box up until they Ignore (the lobby ring self-expires in ~45s) — add an auto-timeout later if needed.

## 2026-06-16 — chat v2 pre10: incoming-ring delivery fix (string SteamIDs) + whole-box drag

pre9 2-device test: the call **connected and the connected box listed both users with a running timer** (screenshot confirmed: 🟢 In call / ● You / ● Stevolit / 00:39 / Mute · Hang up). Two issues reported: (1) initiating a call produced **no pop-up/incoming prompt on the other device** — both users had to tap 🎙 independently for the room to connect; (2) the call box could not be dragged freely (only the header was the grab handle).

**Root cause of (1) — SteamID64 precision loss in the worker.** `BhSteamChatOverlay.postSignal` built the signal envelope with `to`/`from` as **org.json longs → bare JSON numbers**. A SteamID64 (~7.66e16) exceeds JS's `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (9.007e15), so the Cloudflare worker's `JSON.parse` rounded it: `76561199472342656` → `76561199472342660`. The ring was stored at `voice/lobby/<corrupted-id>/…`, but the callee polls `/voice/poll?room=lobby&self=<exact-string-id>` → prefix never matches → empty mailbox → no incoming box. Verified live with curl: POST with numeric `to` → poll empty; POST with **string** `to` → poll returns the signal. The hosted WebRTC page never hit this because it sends ids as strings (from query params), which is why the pair-room SDP/ICE signalling (and thus the call, once both manually joined) worked. **Fix: send `to`/`from` as `String.valueOf(...)` in `postSignal`** (covers rings + byes). Worker untouched — no deploy needed.

**Fix (2) — whole-box drag.** Moved the `DragTouch` `OnTouchListener` from the `header` TextView to the box `root` in `BhVoiceCallBox`. Buttons (clickable) consume their own touches first, so dragging works from any non-button area of the box; it can now be moved anywhere on screen.

Commit `42c0a8b` (The412Banner, no Claude trailer). Build run **27626961728** ✅ success, SEVERE-clean.

NEXT 2-device retest: caller taps 🎙 → Call → **callee's device auto-pops the incoming box** (Answer/Ignore) within ~3s (lobby poll interval) with NO second mic tap; Answer → both Connected w/ timer; confirm the box drags anywhere.

## 2026-06-16 — chat v2 pre11: incoming call shows the caller's name (not the callee's)

pre10 2-device test: incoming-call box now **auto-pops on the callee** (the string-id ring-delivery fix worked) — but it showed the **wrong name**: "The412Banner is calling" on The412Banner's own device (the caller was Stevolit). Root cause: the ring's `name` field was `callPeerName` = the caller's open conversation title, i.e. the *callee's* name, so the callee displayed their own name. Fix: ignore the ring's `name` and **resolve the caller's display name on the callee side from our own friends list** by the ring's `from` SteamID (you can only be called by a friend), fetching `friends.list` once if not cached, fallback "Steam friend". New `resolveFriendName(steamId, fallback)` in `BhSteamChatOverlay` (worker-thread, called from `pollLobbyOnce`). Fixes both the incoming box and the callee's connected participant list (both derive from `callPeerName`, now set to the resolved caller name in `onIncomingRing`).

Genshin APK md5 **`c7b0b36744e7acd44cdb0019982fe2d2`** → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-pre11-Genshin.apk`. Both devices need pre11. NEXT 2-device retest: callee's incoming box + connected list show the **caller's** name; then if clean → merge `feature/steam-chat-v2` → `gamehub-608-build` (What's New in release.yml+README first) → cut stable v1.3.0-608.

## 2026-06-16 — chat v2 pre12: GROUP voice calls (mesh) — Add button + live roster

pre11 1:1 confirmed working (caller name correct). User asked to extend a connected call to add more users. Built **peer-to-peer mesh group calls** (chosen over an SFU — no new infra, reuses our R2 signalling + TURN; practical ~4–5 person cap).

**Worker side** (`bannerhub-api` `6d99a94`, deployed via CF REST + pushed `main`): `/voice/room` rewritten from one RTCPeerConnection to a `Map<peerId→pc>` mesh — discovers members via the new **`/voice/roster`** (R2 presence heartbeat, 15s liveness), opens a pc per member (offerer per pair = smaller id, no glare), routes signals by sender. `/voice/signal`+`/voice/poll` now carry **`from`** (backward-compatible: native ring-poll still reads `.payload`). Page reports the live roster via `BhVoice.roster(csv)`. Fast-path `ensurePc(PEER)` keeps the initial 1:1 instant; call ends when the last peer leaves. **Firmware/imagefs (1.4.2/vc32) + components (568 entries, id 1361) + executeScript all live-verified UNAFFECTED after deploy; bindings (KV+R2+2 secrets) preserved; voice-only diff, no Pages change → no split-brain.**

**Client side** (`e715c9a`): `BhVoiceCallBox.showConnected(List<String>)` renders a dynamic participant list (timer starts once via `connectedShown`); connected buttons = **Mute · ＋ Add · Hang up**; new `showAddPicker(names, AddPicker)` scrollable friend list. `BhVoiceController` gains a `roster` JS-bridge + `Host.onVoiceRoster`. `Controller` tracks `callRoom`+`callRosterIds`, `refreshRoster()` resolves ids→names off-thread (self="You", others via friends list) and re-renders on join/leave; `onAddUser()` lists friends not already in the call and rings the picked one into the SAME `callRoom`.

Build run **27631509370** ✅ success, SEVERE-clean. Genshin APK md5 **`cb0576083bf920185aea4bbb62c5eb4e`** → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-pre12-Genshin.apk`. Both devices need pre12 (3rd tester for a true group test). NEXT 2-device/3-device test: connect a 1:1 call → ＋ Add → pick a friend → they get the incoming box → Answer → all three appear in everyone's participant list + audio is N-way. Then if clean → merge `feature/steam-chat-v2` → `gamehub-608-build` (What's New first) → cut stable v1.3.0-608.

## 2026-06-16 — chat v2 pre13: unique room id per call (fix mesh "stuck Connecting…")

pre12 1:1 regressed to **stuck on "Connecting…"**. Root cause (mesh regression): the room id was a **deterministic SteamID pair — identical every call** (`pairRoom`), so stale offer/answer/ICE from earlier call attempts lingered in that room's R2 mailbox. On a fresh call the offerer's poll applied a **stale answer first** → `signalingState` went to `stable` → the *real* answer was then rejected (`setRemoteDescription` in the wrong state) → ICE never completed → hung on "Connecting…". (The old 1:1 page shared the flaw but only wedged once enough stale signals had accumulated across a day of testing in the same pair room.)

Fix: **generate a fresh unique room id per call** (`newRoomId` = `c` + base36 time + base36 random). The ring already carries the room to the callee (`pendingRoom`), and the mesh page picks the offerer per pair by SteamID — neither needs a derivable room — so every call now starts with an empty mailbox and no stale signals. `pairRoom` removed. **Client-only change — no worker redeploy, so firmware/imagefs/components untouched.**

Commit `1ea923a` (The412Banner, no Claude trailer). Build run **27638609249** ✅ success, SEVERE-clean. Genshin APK md5 **`df694b610b0effdfd6c85d578a27a84f`** → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-pre13-Genshin.apk`. Both devices need pre13. NEXT retest: 1:1 should connect cleanly again; then the group ＋ Add flow.

## 2026-06-16 — chat v2 pre13 verified + pre14: back-to-pill, minimize call box, pill call indicator

pre13 ✅ DEVICE-CONFIRMED: 3-way party call works (You + Stevolit + stevolit74, running timer, dynamic roster). Then two reports: (a) a 4th friend "Glitch" got the incoming box, answered, but stuck on "Connecting…" joining the group; (b) Glitch↔Stevolit **1:1 works** but Glitch can't join the group → rules out NAT/TURN, points at the **group-join / roster-discovery** path.

**Worker fix + diagnostics (`bannerhub-api` `833f71e`, deployed via CF REST):**
- **Root cause of group-join wedge:** joining relies on the roster to discover the *other* members (1:1 uses the direct fast-path). The offerer per pair is the lower SteamID — so if member M (M < joiner) hadn't yet seen the joiner via its roster poll (R2 list lag with 3+ members), **nobody offered** → joiner stuck. Discovery was effectively one-directional.
- **Fix = `hello` bootstrap:** `ensurePc` now sends a tiny `{t:"hello"}` to the peer; `handleFrom` already `ensurePc`s on any inbound message, so a single discovery by *either* side (roster or fast-path) creates both peer connections, and the lower id offers. `ensurePc` dedups → hello can't loop (terminates after one round-trip).
- **`/voice/log` server-side diagnostics:** pages `dlog()` key WebRTC events (init, `roster [...]` on change, `ensurePc <id> offerer=`, `->offer/<-offer/->answer/<-answer` with signalingState, ICE + connection-state per peer, `drop`) → `POST /voice/log`; `GET /voice/log?room=` returns the merged timeline across **all** participants, so a failed join is debuggable without each device's logcat (incl. Glitch's). Roster poll 3s→2.5s. **Firmware 1.4.2/vc32 + components (id 1361) + executeScript live-verified UNAFFECTED; bindings 4/4; voice-only diff; no Pages change.**

**Client pre14 (`23aa5fc`):** (1) **Back** (device button or gamepad B/back) collapses the open chat panel to the pill — consumed via `container.dispatchKeyEvent` only while `expanded`, else passes to the game. (2) Call box **follows the chat**: minimized to the pill when collapsed, restored when expanded, via a single `renderCallBox()`/`shouldShowBox()` path; `BhVoiceCallBox.hide()` detaches but keeps state + Chronometer base (timer.start() now called every showConnected so it resumes on re-attach); an **incoming ring always pops** regardless of collapse. (3) **Pill call indicator**: green pulsing 🎧 + party-count badge overlaid on the pill (FrameLayout wrap, non-clickable so touches fall through to the pill) while a call is active; tap pill → chat + box return. callUi state machine ("", idle/ringing/incoming/connecting/connected) is the single source of truth. (First build `27640939262` FAILED — stray `*/` in the hide() javadoc; fixed `23aa5fc`.)

Build run **27641099786** ✅ success, SEVERE-clean. Genshin APK md5 **`35304b853c345d53e76a536da878a8fa`** → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-pre14-Genshin.apk`. NEXT: retest the group ＋ Add with Glitch (hello fix should let him join); if it still fails, `curl /voice/log?room=<roomId>` for the merged timeline. Also test back-to-pill + the pill 🎧 badge + minimize/restore.

## 2026-06-16 — TURN fix confirmed (3-way across networks) + pre15: collapse tile + pill unread count

**TURN fix DEVICE-CONFIRMED:** after switching `/voice/turn` to Cloudflare Realtime TURN (api repo `5c2d61e`), `/voice/log` showed all 3 pairs reaching `ice connected`+`pc connected` (Glitch↔You, Stevolit↔You, Glitch↔Stevolit) — the You↔Glitch pair that previously died at `ice checking→failed` now connects via relay; user confirmed full 3-way audio. (Observed some transient connect→disconnected→failed→auto-reconnect flapping; mesh self-heals via roster re-discovery. Optional future polish: `pc.restartIce()` on transient `disconnected` instead of drop+recreate.)

**pre15 — two user-requested pre-stable UI tweaks** (decision: call box stays coupled to chat = keep pre14; just add the tile + unread count):
- **Collapsible call tile** (`BhVoiceCallBox`): the connected box gains a collapse button (—) → compact tile showing `🎧 N in call` + running timer + ＋Add + Hang up; tap the tile (non-button area) to expand back to the full box (Mute only in full). `collapsed` flag + `lastParticipants` cache; `renderFullConnected`/`renderTile` off `showConnected(List)`; timer continuous (Chronometer base preserved, `start()` every render). `DragTouch` now distinguishes tap vs drag → tap-on-tile expands. `close()` resets collapse/chrome.
- **Pill unread count** (`BhSteamChatOverlay`): blue unread-message badge on the pill (inner-bottom) shown only while chat is closed, **alongside** the green 🎧 call badge (inner-top) — both gated to the collapsed state (`updatePillBadge` now also hides when expanded). Tracking: `steam:chat-message` subscription moved to **always-on (subscribed at attach)**; on an incoming msg you're not viewing → debounced `refreshUnread()` (700ms) which re-sums `friends.conversation_summaries` (authoritative `unreadByFriend`); plus ~24s backstop poll in the lobby thread (catches reads on other devices); opening chat clears (`pillUnread=0`), closing re-syncs.

Build run **27644130290** ✅ success, SEVERE-clean. Genshin APK md5 **`970a1f1c531997ce03484c3fcf9e394c`** → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-pre15-Genshin.apk`. NEXT: test collapse-to-tile + tap-expand + the pill unread count; then merge `feature/steam-chat-v2`→`gamehub-608-build` (What's New first) + cut stable v1.3.0-608.

## 2026-06-16 — chat v2 pre16: incoming-call settings (⚙) — ringtone + vibrate

User-requested ⚙ cog in the Friends panel header → an incoming-call settings screen. Ringtone sources: **4 synthesized tones** (Classic/Chime/Trill/Soft beep via `ToneGenerator`, no files); **5 bundled MP3s** the user provided, baked into `assets/bh_ringtones/` (basic, columns_enigma, doom_classic, super_mario_brothers, tututu); a **Custom MP3** the end-user picks (`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` + persistable URI); and **Silent** (box still pops). Each option has a **▶ preview** (≤5s). Plus a **Vibrate on incoming** toggle (default on).

- **New `BhRingtone`** engine: token model `silent` / `synth:<id>` / `asset:<file>` / `uri:<uri>`; loops on incoming, ≤5s preview, plays on the media stream (audible over game audio), looping vibrate (VibrationEffect waveform / legacy), session-guarded async MediaPlayer.
- **New `BhRingtonePickerActivity`** (transparent, exported=false): picks an MP3, takes persistable read grant, stores `uri:<…>` to `BhSteamChatController`.
- **`BhSteamChatController`**: `KEY_RINGTONE` (default `asset:basic.mp3`) + `KEY_VIBRATE` (default true) getters/setters.
- **`BhSteamChatOverlay`**: ⚙ cog → `showSettings()`/`renderSettings()` (selectable ringtone rows ●/○ + preview, Custom MP3 row launches picker, Vibrate toggle); ring+vibrate started in `onIncomingRing`, stopped on Answer/Ignore/Hang up/detach; unanswered call auto-dismisses after 30s; preview stops on leaving settings / collapse (guarded so it never kills a real ring).
- **Patches**: `steamChatRingtonesAssetPatch` (bundle the 5 MP3s → assets) + `steamChatRingtonePickerManifestPatch` (register picker activity + add VIBRATE perm), both wired into `steamChatOverlayPatch.dependsOn`.

Build run **27646135842** ✅ success, SEVERE-clean. Genshin APK md5 **`d617f9460496521b096542202efca358`** → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-pre16-Genshin.apk`. NEXT: test ⚙ ringtone selection/preview + vibrate + ring-on-incoming; then (user-approved, AFTER pre16 test) add **"Share call link" + guest browser-join** so non-BannerHub/PC/other-emulator users can join the WebRTC mesh via the hosted `/voice/room` page (Steam native voice NOT bridgeable). Then merge → stable v1.3.0-608.

## 2026-06-16 — pre16 verified + pre17: share-call link (guest join) + ringtone volume + play/pause preview

pre16 device-tested ✅ ringtones work. pre17 adds:
- **Share call link / guest browser-join** (user asked: invite non-BannerHub/PC/other-emulator people). 🔗 Invite button (full call box + tile) shares `…/voice/room?room=<id>` via the Android share sheet. Worker (`bannerhub-api` `671bf23`, deployed): the call page mints a random **guest id** when `?self=` is omitted, so anyone with a browser joins the mesh (TURN works for them too). Steam **native** voice still not bridgeable — browser link is the only outsider path. Client roster switched `long[]→String[]` so guest ids (non-numeric) appear; non-Steam ids label as "Guest"/"Guest N".
- **Ringtone volume slider** (0–100%) in ⚙ settings — live during preview, applied to preview + real incoming ring (media `setVolume` + synth `ToneGenerator` volume); `KEY_RINGTONE_VOLUME` default 100.
- **Play/pause preview** — the ▶ becomes ■ while previewing (loops until stopped), tracked by `previewingToken`; selecting a tone or leaving settings stops it. (`BhRingtone.preview` now loops, no 5s auto-stop; added `setVolume` for live changes.)

Build run **27647002098** ✅ success, SEVERE-clean. Genshin APK md5 **`5a5d98effb9eb1585b02ab26902ec7c0`** → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-pre17-Genshin.apk`. Firmware/components/TURN re-verified intact after the worker guest-id deploy. NEXT: test 🔗 invite (open link on a PC/browser → joins as Guest), volume slider, play/pause preview; then the **app-wide overlay** (Banner Tools toggle to run the overlay before/while in game) + merge → stable v1.3.0-608.

## 🏁 STABLE SHIPPED — `v1.3.0-608` (Latest) — 2026-06-16

Merged `feature/steam-chat-v2` → `gamehub-608-build` and cut the new stable. The `-608` semver advances `v1.2.0-608` → **`v1.3.0-608`** (same GameHub 6.0.8 base, versionCode 119, stable keystore → installs in place).

**Headline:** in-game Steam **voice calls** (1:1 + party, WebRTC via the BannerHub Worker origin + Cloudflare Realtime TURN, device-confirmed across ISPs; movable/collapsible call box, incoming ring with caller name + 30s auto-dismiss, ringtone settings = synth/bundled/custom-MP3/silent + volume + preview + vibrate, party mesh + roster, 🔗 share-call link for guest browser join, pill 🎧+unread badges) plus **Steam chat overlay v2** (3-tab ☺ emoji/emoticon/sticker picker, send-image via Worker/R2, game-invite cards, typing indicators, auto-scroll, collapsible pill opacity).

**Process:**
- Updated What's New BEFORE cutting — README (`## What's new in v1.3.0-608`, Latest badge, TOC + anchor, past-notes line) + `release.yml` body (`bc9cd10`/rebased `9c8807f`).
- FF-merge blocked by 69 hourly `chore: refresh download badge data` auto-commits on remote → **rebased** the 38 feature commits onto `origin/gamehub-608-build` (clean, no conflicts — badge data file untouched by feature work), pushed.
- Explore What's New verified accurate to the app (user ask): `gen_whatsnew.py` output = voice + chat v2 bullets; also added **"In-game Steam friends, chat & voice-call overlay (no root)"** to the "EVERYTHING WE'VE ADDED" tail in `explore/bh_explore.json` (`cee02b6`) — it had never listed the overlay since v1.1.0.

**Release:** run **27647952999** ✅ success, **SEVERE-clean**, tag `v1.3.0-608` on `gamehub-608-build`, marked **Latest**. 13 assets (9 APK + bh_explore.json + 3 .rvp). Shipped `bh_explore.json` stamped version `1.3.0-608` / build `608010300`, What's New correct.

**Delivered:** Genshin variant → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-Genshin.apk`, md5 **`626156127708d2baa53c7fcb1b6fe9aa`**.

**Pending follow-ups:** update the bannerhub-site v6 page (don't push until user go); the **app-wide overlay** feature (Banner Tools toggle to run the overlay across all BannerHub screens, not just in-game) remains designed-but-unbuilt.

## 2026-06-17 — feature/voice-room-codes: cross-compat with BannerHub 3.7.5 voice rooms

Branch `feature/voice-room-codes` off `gamehub-608-build`. Goal: let v6 users **join a BannerHub 3.7.5 room code** (or share a code/link 3.7.5 users can join), and show each other's names.

**Key finding (code-verified, both sides + worker):** the signaling layer is *already* cross-compatible. The worker `/voice/room` mesh page is identity-agnostic — peers discovered via `/voice/roster`, one `RTCPeerConnection` per member, offerer = string compare `SELF<id`, **no Steam check**; `VOICE_ID_RE=/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,40}$/` accepts both a 3.7.5 short code and v6's SteamID-pair room. A 3.7.5 user and a v6 user in the same `room` string connect and talk today. The only gaps were v6-client-side.

**What v6 was missing (now added):**
1. **No room-code path** — v6 only ever derived `room` from a sorted SteamID pair and only dialed via Steam friends. Added a "🔊" header button → in-panel **Voice room by code** screen (name + Room code + Create/Join), mirroring 3.7.5's `BhVoiceOverlay`. Create mints a **5-char code from the same alphabet** `abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyz23456789` 3.7.5 uses (interchangeable). Reuses the panel's existing focusable-EditText handling (`setWindowFocusable`).
2. **No `name=` param** — v6's voice URL sent only `room/self/peer`. `BhVoiceController` now sends `&name=<display>` and **omits `peer`** in code-room mode (full-mesh). Added a second ctor `(act, roomCode, selfId, displayName, host)`; the Steam ctor delegates (sends no name → unchanged behavior, no regression).
3. **Couldn't display nickname-only peers** — `BhVoiceController.Bridge` had no `rosterNames`, so the worker's name map never reached v6 (3.7.5 peers showed as "Guest"). Added `rosterNames` JS bridge + `Host.onVoiceRosterNames`; `refreshRoster()` now prefers a self-declared nickname over SteamID lookup / "Guest" (snapshotted to the IO thread).

Identity for code rooms is **Steam-independent**: self id = SteamID when signed in else a stable per-install `bh-…` client id (`BhSteamChatController.getVoiceClientId`); display name persisted (`getVoiceName`, default `Player-<id4>`). No new manifest perms (RECORD_AUDIO/MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS already added by `SteamChatVoiceManifestPatch`). Worker + bannerhub-api **untouched**.

Files: `BhVoiceController.java` (+ctor/name/rosterNames), `BhSteamChatController.java` (+voice name/client-id prefs), `BhSteamChatOverlay.java` (+🔊 screen, startRoomCall, rosterNames plumbing). NEXT = build + device test: v6 Create code ↔ 3.7.5 Join (and reverse), confirm two-way audio + names on both rosters.

**Build + delivery:** pushed `feature/voice-room-codes` (`0cc5b02`); release.yml workflow_dispatch prerelease `1.3.0-608-rooms-pre1` (stable=false, artifact-only) → run **27727887461** ✅ success. Genshin artifact (`apk-Genshin`) → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-rooms-pre1-Genshin.apk`, md5 **`367fc5eb5f86a15ec60830af84b30179`** (48,652,556 bytes). Fresh CI debug keystore → uninstall any existing v6 first if it won't install in place. Worker + bannerhub-api untouched (zero server changes); shipped v1.3.0-608 unaffected. AWAITING 2-device test: v6 🔊 Create code ↔ 3.7.5 Join (and reverse) — two-way audio + names (not "Guest") on both rosters; plus a normal Steam 🎙 call for no-regression.

### 2026-06-17 (later) — rooms-pre2: room box no longer stuck on "Connecting…"

Device feedback on pre1: creating/joining a room code dropped into a bare **"Connecting…"** screen with no code and no user list, and never advanced. Root cause: `startRoomCall()` set `callUi="connecting"` → `BhVoiceCallBox.showConnecting()` (status-only), and the box only flips to the connected view on the WebRTC `in-call` event — which never fires for a solo room (no peer yet). The roster callbacks also only refreshed once `callConnected` was already true, so the waiting list never populated.

Fix (mirrors BannerHub 3.7.5's waiting-room UX, its fix #4): Create/Join now drops **straight into the room view**.
- `BhVoiceCallBox.showRoom(code, participants, liveConnected)` — header `🔊 Room · CODE · N` while waiting → `🟢 In call · CODE · N` once a peer joins; body `Connecting — waiting for others to join…` → `Tap 🔗 to invite more people`; the **room code and user list are always shown** (list starts with "You" and fills in as people join); the call timer appears only when a peer actually connects. Buttons: `＋ Add · 🔗 · Leave` while waiting, gaining `Mute` and the collapse `—` once connected. New `lastRoomCode`/`lastRoomConnected` + `reExpand()` so collapse/expand and roster updates re-render the room view (not the Steam 1:1 view).
- `BhSteamChatOverlay`: `renderCallBox()` routes code rooms to `showRoom(waiting)` for `connecting` and `showRoom(live)` for `connected`; `onVoiceRoster`/`onVoiceRosterNames` refresh the roster for code rooms **before** a peer connects (`shouldShowBox() && (callConnected || codeRoom)`); `refreshRoster()` renders `showRoom` for code rooms and `showConnected` for Steam 1:1. Steam 1:1 path untouched (`showConnected` clears `lastRoomCode`).

2 files, additive. Note: the first push was rejected by GitHub email-privacy (GH007); re-authored to the repo's existing noreply address `205237651+The412Banner@users.noreply.github.com`.

**Build + delivery:** commit `e847514` pushed; release.yml prerelease `1.3.0-608-rooms-pre2` → run **27728486541** ✅ success, 0 SEVERE. Genshin artifact → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.0-608-rooms-pre2-Genshin.apk`, md5 **`efcf065b5cd3e04cb3a12c34ed882453`** (48,607,500 bytes). Fresh CI keystore → uninstall existing v6 first if it won't install in place. NEXT = 2-device cross-build test (v6 🔊 Create ↔ 3.7.5 Join + reverse): room box shows code + roster immediately, upgrades to timer + two-way audio on join, names on both rosters; plus a Steam 🎙 call for no-regression. If clean → merge both branches + cut releases.

### 2026-06-17 (later) — ✅ CROSS-BUILD VOICE DEVICE-CONFIRMED (rooms-pre2)

Tested on two physical devices on **different networks**. Both directions gave **two-way audio**:
- BannerHub **3.7.5 Create** room → **V6 Join** by code ✅
- **V6 Create** room → BannerHub **3.7.5 Join** by code ✅

Confirms (a) the cross-build room-code feature works end-to-end across NAT (shared worker mesh + CF TURN, no Steam check), and (b) the pre2 fix — Create/Join drops straight into the room box (code + roster, "waiting for others to join…" → green timer on join) with no stuck "Connecting…" screen.

**Cross-build voice feature is COMPLETE.** Next: merge `feature/voice-room-codes` → `gamehub-608-build` (write What's New first) and cut the v6 release; on the 3.7.5 side merge `voice-chat` → main and cut the 3.7.x release. Open enhancement under discussion: have V6 auto-use the signed-in user's Steam persona name instead of a separately-picked name.

### 2026-06-18 — 🏁 STABLE v1.3.1-608 SHIPPED (Latest)

Merged `feature/voice-room-codes` into the mainline and cut the stable. The room-code cross-build voice feature (device-confirmed both directions across networks) is now released.

- **Merge:** rebased the 6 feature commits onto the live `gamehub-608-build` tip (clearing the hourly download-badge auto-commit that blocks fast-forwards) and FF-merged in (`7534d0f..8e9d10b`).
- **Release notes (done before cutting):** README "What's new in **v1.3.1-608**" → 🔊 Voice room codes / cross-play; demoted 1.3.0 voice+chat to carryover; bumped the Latest badge + TOC anchor. `release.yml` stable body updated to match (version heading auto-fills). The in-app Explore "What's New" regenerates in CI from the README via `gen_whatsnew.py` — confirmed in the shipped `bh_explore.json` ("WHAT'S NEW IN v1.3.1-608 • Voice room codes — cross-play with BannerHub 3.8.0").
- **Naming:** the cross-play notes reference **BannerHub 3.8.0** (not 3.7.5) — the current 3.7.5 build does not have the cross-build voice; it ships in the upcoming **3.8.0** stable (BannerHub repo `voice-chat` → main, not yet cut). The `3.7.x` lineage/disclaimer mentions stay as-is.
- **Build:** `release.yml` `version=1.3.1-608 stable=true` on `gamehub-608-build` → run **27729146589** ✅ success, 0 SEVERE. Published GitHub Release **v1.3.1-608**, marked **Latest**, 13 assets (9 APK + `bh_explore.json` + 3 `.rvp`). Genshin md5 **`27de8e21d78b46a65cd1016ee86b279e`** → `/storage/emulated/0/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.3.1-608-Genshin.apk`. Installs in place over `v1.3.0-608` (same keystore).

**Next on this repo:** none required for v1.3.1. Open enhancement still on the table: V6 auto-use the signed-in Steam persona name instead of a picked name. Counterpart release: cut **BannerHub 3.8.0** on the BannerHub repo so the 3.8.0 cross-play reference has its build.

## 2026-06-18 — GameHub 6.0.9 patch re-derivation worklist (branch `gamehub-609-build`)

> 🏁🏁 **DONE — STABLE `v1.0.0-609` SHIPPED (Latest) 2026-06-18.** Release run `27783457578` (13 assets = 9 APK + bh_explore.json + 3 .rvp, Explore What's New card synced + version stamped). All 9 root patches + cascades + privacy suite + chat/voice overlay device-confirmed on 6.0.9. README + bannerhub-site updated; release-notes prose rewritten; default branch = `gamehub-609-build`. Re-derivation + release complete.
>
> **POST-RELEASE 2026-06-18:** #9 analytics also DEVICE-CONFIRMED via DNSWatch capture (zero `vgabc.com/events` egress + `CONN OUT 127.0.0.1:80` redirect live) — all 9 root now device-confirmed. **PRIVACY.md rewritten in plain English** (layman-first; smali/Plan-N jargon moved to the linked commits; kept all hosts + honest leftovers + Cloudflare trust-shift + verify steps + 6.0.9 DNSWatch evidence). **bannerhub-site** (separate repo, GitHub Pages — auto-deploys on push) updated for 609 + **site-wide accuracy sweep**: fixed v6-privacy.html (device-perf endpoint name, verify-step described the obsolete 6.0.4 stub, added 6.0.9 DNSWatch evidence), compare.html (cross-play-voice-rooms since v1.3.1-608 / offline-picker "working v1.0.0-609"), faq.html (Firebase no longer listed as "remaining" — it's killed; BannerHub v3.7.x→v3.8.x), v6.html (privacy stack 7→8 patches), why.html. Lesson: bulk `sed v1.3.1-608→v1.0.0-609` corrupts historical "since" labels — re-audit after.

Setup for 6.0.9 (vc121) is done: base uploaded (`base-apk-609`), CI repointed, `GAMEHUB_VERSION` gate bumped 6.0.8→6.0.9, diff written (`gamehub_reports/GAMEHUB_609_vs_608_DIFF.md`). 6.0.9 = feature release (native Team Room + Tencent TRTC voice), **no Wine/DXVK/Turnip/renderer change** → container/imagefs/renderer patches carry over untouched.

Smoke-test run **27760047512** (gate=6.0.9) generated the real failure set: **14 patches fail = 9 root fingerprint breakages + 5 cascades** (R8 reshuffled obfuscated anchors again — same family as 607→608). ReVanced exits 0 on skipped patches, so "green" ≠ applied; read the `SEVERE: "X" failed:` lines.

> **WORKING RULE (per user, 2026-06-18):** after EACH patch below is fixed, update BOTH this progress log (check the box + commit anchor + how it was re-pinned) AND the `project_gamehub_609_base` memory file. Do both every time, not in a batch at the end.
> **DEVICE-TEST RULE (per user, 2026-06-18):** EVERY patch re-applied/re-derived on a base bump must be **device-tested and confirmed working** before it counts as done — CI apply-confirmed is NOT enough (ReVanced exits 0 on skips; patcher doesn't validate extension `Class.forName` constants).
>
> **ORDER RULE (per user, 2026-06-18) — FIXED on every base bump:**
> 1. **Bypass login** + **Debug logging** FIRST — confirmed working (device-confirmed) before moving on.
> 2. **Redirect catalog API** (+ **Prefix API path with /v6** cascade) — **with device verification**.
> 3. **Explore tab hijack** — **with device verification**.
> 4. THEN the keystone (**Per-game menu id capture**, #1) and all remaining patches.
>
> CI "green" ≠ working — steps 2 and 3 each require on-device confirmation, not just an apply-confirmed CI run.

### Root failures — need fingerprint re-derivation (9)
- [x] 3. **Bypass login** — ✅ RE-DERIVED + CI APPLY-CONFIRMED (commit `08decac`; run 27762795208) + **🔧 RUNTIME FIX `0870713`** (build pre2 run 27763795675). PATCH anchors: AUTH_IMPL Lfw0→**Lux0**, AUTH_INTERFACE Lcw0→**Lrx0**, AUTH_TOKEN Lt2l→**Lqbm**, GAME_LIB_REPO Ldm7→**Lqv7**, NAVIGATOR Lj8d→**Ljrd**; FakeStateFlow udi/q4g/s3d→**a5j/crg/smd**. ⚠️ EXTENSION runtime `Class.forName` constants ALSO needed bumping (patcher does NOT validate these → apply was green but on-device the added game didn't show): **FakeUserAccount n2l→kbm** (= Lrx0;.b() return, 27-field; stale → get() null → userFlow wraps null → library reader flatMapLatest empty despite row in t_game_library_base — THE reported bug), **FakeAuthToken t2l→qbm** (= Lrx0;.f() return, 10-field). Both ctor sigs byte-identical to 608. Method names (auth a–h, save x, userid h, gates i/s) unchanged. LESSON: on every bump the login fix needs BOTH the patch fingerprints AND the 3 extension class constants (FakeStateFlow/FakeUserAccount/FakeAuthToken). ✅ **DEVICE-CONFIRMED 2026-06-18 on pre2 (run 27763795675, Genshin md5 `56dd62d0c0209637e1773095e046c807`): login bypassed + added local game now shows in library.**
- [x] 4. **Debug logging** — ✅ RE-DERIVED + **CI APPLY-CONFIRMED** (commit `08decac`; run **27762795208**). Y2D_INTERFACE Lw9c→**Llsc** (err method a→**e**), Y2D_IMPL Ly86→**Lrh6** (method a→**e**), SAVE_REPO Ldm7→**Lqv7** (=GAME_LIB_REPO, method x unchanged), IMPORT_TXN Lza→**Lcb** (method x→**w**).
- [x] 1. **Per-game menu id capture (shared)** — 🔑 KEYSTONE. ✅ RE-DERIVED + **CI APPLY-CONFIRMED** (commit `844118e`; pre5 run `27770060016`: `INFO: "Per-game menu id capture (shared)" succeeded`) + ✅ **DEVICE-CONFIRMED 2026-06-18 on pre7 Normal** (md5 `64639582bb6b967a7e27904057b74a13`): Banner Tools row shows in per-game menu and opens the consolidated dialog (Vibration/Game ID/Audio/GOG/Overlay/Root tiles all render — screenshot `Screenshot_20260618-121218.png`), end-to-end keystone chain working. 3 builder anchors re-pinned (608→609): More Menu `La37;->a(Le17;ILdv6;Lhh7;Leh3;I)V`→**`Llc7;->a(Lpa7;ILr47;Lrq7;Lgm3;I)V`** (row ctor `Lwyc(Lm55,String,Lfv6)`→**`Luhd(Lqd5,String,Lt47)`** ×11); Tile popup `Lb8c;->f(Lc8c;Lfv6;Ldv6;ZLiyc;Leh3;I)V`→**`Lqqc;->f(Lrqc;Lt47;Lr47;ZLfhd;Lgm3;I)V`** (row ctor `Lj6c`→**`Lxoc(String,Lqd5,String,Lr47)`** ×5); List popup `Lhvb;->b0(Lsza;Z+9L)List`→**`Lxdc;->b0(Ljhb;Z+8L)List`** (609 dropped one param + one row). `captureGameId` ext is R8-proof (toString token + kept GameInfo) → no constant bump. ⏳ DEVICE-VERIFY pending (needs cascade rows below to render). KEY FINDING: the "cascade auto-fix" note is partly right — **GameId + GOG row patches are 100% `if(false)` → they fail ONLY as ReVanced dependency-cascades** (dependsOn keystone+vibration resolver), so they auto-clear once deps fixed. But **Banner Tools menu row (live 3 injections) + PC Vibration Settings menu row (live resolver hook) have their OWN broken anchors** → need explicit re-pin. Cascade inner-anchors already gathered: M1 LIST_BUILDER `Lm3c`→**`Lbmc`**, M2 collector `Llp0;->R`→**`Lxq0;->a0([Object)ArrayList`**, M3 finalize `Lny2;->C`→**`Lv33;->u(List)Lbmc`**.
- [x] 2. **Redirect catalog API** — ✅ RE-DERIVED + CI APPLY-CONFIRMED (commit `05eb358`; run 27765728865 — gone from SEVERE) + ✅ **DEVICE-CONFIRMED 2026-06-18 (pre3 Normal, md5 `0f035920fbc3121e95cf842c106d7a98`).** ENV_ENUM_CLASS `Lqnh;`→**`Lyei;`** (smali_classes3/yei.smali, `public final enum`, both catalog hosts in `<clinit>` cn→v5 oversea→v6, Online value built first via `invoke-direct/range {v0 .. v6}` 6-arg `<init>`; ONLY class in apk with both hosts). Register-agnostic patch, only the class constant changed.
- [x] 5. **Explore tab hijack** — ✅ RE-DERIVED + **CI APPLY-CONFIRMED** (commit `71c7a48`; pre4 run `27767798768`: `INFO: "Explore tab hijack" succeeded` all 9 variants, gone from SEVERE) + ✅ **DEVICE-CONFIRMED 2026-06-18 on pre4 Genshin** (md5 `7f38bde856d9168f8d702bd6a7875e23`: tapping Explore bottom-nav opens BannerExploreActivity, not the xiaoji feed). Single-constant re-pin: `TAB_ENUM` `Lkd9;`→**`Lrn9;`** in `ExploreTabHijackPatch.kt`. 608→609 map: tab-select VM `di9`→**`ys9`**, dispatch `u`→**`t`**, tab enum `Lkd9;`→**`Lrn9;`** (smali_classes4/rn9.smali = `public final enum extends Enum`, 5 values a–e = HOME(0)/PLAY(1)/LEADERBOARD(2)/LIBRARY(3)/PROFILE(4), byte-identical ordinal mapping to kd9). Anchor stays structural (`parameterTypes==[Lrn9;] && returnType==V && const-string "main_menu"`) → matches UNIQUE `ys9.t(Lrn9;)V` (sibling `ys9.r(Lrn9;)V` has NO "main_menu"; `ys9.v` takes `Las9;` plain class; `rs9.<init>(Lrn9;)V` is a ctor w/o "main_menu"). `t` has `.locals 11`, p1=high reg → `move-object/from16 v0, p1` injection sound; label targets Kotlin's leading `getClass()` null-check. ✅ **Extension R8-proof:** `BhExploreTabClick.maybeHijack` only checks `instanceof Enum` + `ordinal()==0` (no obfuscated refs); `BhExploreActions` only `Class.forName`s OUR own classes (`GogMainActivity`) + direct calls into our handlers → NO runtime-stale `Class.forName` trap on 609 (memory warning doesn't bite here). NOTE: the "bannertools" Explore card routes into the keystone-family `BhBannerToolsMenuRowClick` → that one card stays dead until #1 keystone is fixed (expected).
- [x] 6. **Offline component picker — local list** — ✅ RE-DERIVED + CI APPLY-CONFIRMED (commit `bf56a46`; pre12 run `27781144352`) + ✅ **DEVICE-CONFIRMED 2026-06-18 pre12 (FIRST TIME EVER WORKING)** — offline pickers populated + user picked already-downloaded components; log `getList type=2 built=284 OK / type=3 built=51 / type=4 built=9`, no failures/crash. The `n55→yi5` success-wrapper fix was the cure. TWO fixes: (1) patch anchor GOF_CLASS `Ll6e;`→**`Lrpe;`** (a(Lrpe;,ComponentType,I,Lpv3;,I)Object page=200→b; c(Lpv3;)Object .locals 11; Continuation Lkq3;→Lpv3; not anchored). (2) ⚠️ **EXTENSION success-wrapper N55_SUCCESS `n55`→`yi5` = the "never worked" root cause** — confirmed via the rpe.a caller unwrap (as5.smali): `check-cast Lzi5;`(sealed base) `instance-of Lyi5;`(SUCCESS) `iget Lyi5;->a:Object` `check-cast List`. Wrong wrapper → newSuccess() null → synthesise() null → fell back to offline-empty original. 608 n55/o55→609 yi5/zi5 (error Lxi5;). ENV_LAYER/STATE_ENUM kept names verified; EnvLayerEntity field mapping intact. ⚠️ DEVICE-VERIFY = go OFFLINE (after downloading components while online so sp_winemu_unified_resources.xml is populated) → component/container pickers list local downloads.
- [x] 7. **PC-accurate vibration** — ✅ RE-DERIVED + CI APPLY-CONFIRMED (commit `79b1841`; pre11 run `27777870763`) + ✅ **DEVICE-CONFIRMED 2026-06-18 pre11** (md5 `0700cd9aadb6120c8b49e847b3c7ca36`): rumble dispatches (`container=63362 mode=1 intensity=100`) + intensity scaling (user-selected lower felt lower) + winebus disk-patch applied on relaunch (`applied offsets=0x974c,0x977c`, `scan winebus=1 patched=1`) → sustained rumble, 0 crashes. NOTE: fresh-install FIRST launch scans before container unpacks (winebus=0, self-resets) → sustained needs ONE relaunch (expected). Recon: of the 4 hooks + native patcher, only ONE break: obfuscated `PHYSICAL_CLASS` `Lpz7;`→**`Ly98;`** (multi-motor device; extends base `Lrz7;`→`Laa8;`; `h(II)V` .locals3+const 0xffff, `g()V` .locals1, field `f:I` device-id, field `k:Lkwk` motor-mgr, `i()List` multi-motor; sibling `z98`=single-Vibrator decoy w/ `f:Z`+Context). Method/field names `h`/`g`/`f:I` preserved. Hooks 1 `GamepadServerManager.onRumble(III)V` & 4 `WineActivity.onCreate(Bundle)V` (.locals 20→from16 valid) = kept (non-obfuscated) names, unaffected. Native `winebus.so` disk patcher (BhVibrationController) = pattern-based + NO Wine container change in 609 → unaffected; its reflection is framework ActivityThread walk (no obfuscated Class.forName). Device-verify = in-game sustained dual-motor rumble with a controller.
- [x] 8. **Show PC Game Settings row** — ✅ RE-DERIVED + CI APPLY-CONFIRMED (commit `70eee3c`; pre9 run `27774641617`) + ✅ **DEVICE-CONFIRMED on pre10** (Normal md5 `70a1af51d5a25eea129f6a61fc653d62`: PC Game Settings row visible in game-detail More Menu and opens correctly, no crash). Pure bytecode patch (removes if-eqz gate; no runtime ext). 608→609: menu method `La37;->Llc7;` `(Lpa7;ILr47;Lrq7;Lgm3;I)V` + ROW_DATA `Lwyc`→`Luhd` ctor `(Lqd5,String,Lt47)` (shared keystone map). **PC-settings label model changed**: now a lazy `Lkwk` wrapper over an `Lwik(0x15)` Function0 provider (`wik.b()` builds `"string:features_game_pc_settings"`; idx 0x14→0x15 = one string added); cached at `Lnkk;->q0:Lkwk` (was `Lssj;->c0:Lb4k`). Wrapper `Lb4k`→`Lkwk`. Sole sget in lc7.a; gate `if-eqz v51,:cond_55` ~6 instrs before → removed by backward-scan. Device-verify = PC Game Settings row shows in Explorer game-detail More Menu for Steam-linked games.
- [x] 9. **Stub analytics events** — ✅ RE-DERIVED + CI APPLY-CONFIRMED (commit `9db00d9`; pre8 run `27773508828`) + ✅ **DEVICE-CONFIRMED 2026-06-18** via DNSWatch capture (`/storage/emulated/0/Download/dns/dnswatch-20260618-150511.txt`): ZERO `vgabc.com/events` egress during a real session + visible `CONN OUT TCP 127.0.0.1:80` = the analytics POST redirected to loopback live. String/marker-anchored patch (class reshuffle is a no-op: batch reporter `Lzy5`→`Ll76`, device-perf `Lb34`→`Lvw3`) — failure was an ENDPOINT PATH CHANGE: device-perf `/events/device-performance-config`→**`/events/device-performance-session-summary`**. Only `DEVICE_PERF_SUFFIX` updated; plain `/events` URL + `vgabc.com/events` marker unchanged (marker still catches all dev2/beta/prod variants of both reporters). No runtime extension (rewrites const-strings in place) → no Class.forName stale risk. Device-verify = analytics POSTs go to 127.0.0.1 (no vgabc.com/events egress).

All 9 threw `Required value was null` (fingerprint matched nothing).

### Cascade failures — should auto-resolve once their root is re-pinned (5)
- [x] Banner Tools menu row — ✅ CI APPLY-CONFIRMED (commit `ee9cacd`; pre6 run `27770729655`) + ✅ **DEVICE-CONFIRMED 2026-06-18 pre7 Normal** (row shows + dialog renders all 6 tiles, screenshot `Screenshot_20260618-121218.png`). LIVE 3-injection patch re-pinned: builders same as keystone (lc7.a/qqc.f/xdc.b0) + ROW_DATA `Lwyc`→`Luhd`, LIST_BUILDER `Lm3c`→`Lbmc`, ctor `(Lm55,String,Lfv6)`→`(Lqd5,String,Lt47)`; tile `Lj6c`→`Lxoc`, collector `Llp0;->R`→`Lxq0;->a0`; finalize `Lny2;->C`→`Lv33;->u`. ✅ RUNTIME `BhBannerToolsMenuRowClick` REWRITTEN for 609 icon model (commit `e1452bd`; pre7 run `27772524242`). 609 row "icon" param = `Lqd5` DrawableResource (extends `Lo4h`, sibling of StringResource `Llok`), NOT an ImageVector — old `Lv45.l → Lkwk.getValue()` unwrap removed; new `loadStaticIcon()`; icon-fail skips row (fail-safe). Consts: appendBannerToolsRowTo wyc→uhd/icon→qd5/fv6→t47(Function1); appendScdRowToTedList j6c→xoc/dv6→r47(Function0)/icon qd5; appendLibraryPopupRow vtc→**pcd** (ctor `(Llok;Lr47;I)V` — NO icon)/kwj→lok/vhg→o4h/onClick r47. ⚠️ **DEVICE-FOUND CRASH (pre9) + FIX (pre10 commit `2c04d41`):** opening game-detail More Menu threw `SAXParseException: Unexpected token PNG …IHDR` at `lc7.m`→DocumentBuilder.parse — 609 row-icon render path XML-parses the `Lqd5` (vector loader), so the first icon pick `Leyn.b` (a PNG DrawableResource) crashed. Fix: `loadStaticIcon()` now reflects **`Lyc5;->x:Lkwk;`** + `getValue()` = the EXACT Lqd5 a NATIVE More-Menu row passes to its Luhd ctor in lc7.a (sget@2073→Luhd@2155), guaranteed vector/renderable. LESSON: 609 row icons MUST be vector(XML) Lqd5 — reuse a native row's icon, never a random static Lqd5 (many are PNG). pre7 "device-confirmed" was only the DIALOG (bundled bh_*.xml tiles); ROW ✅ **DEVICE-CONFIRMED on pre10** (Normal md5 `70a1af51d5a25eea129f6a61fc653d62`: More Menu opens, no crash, row renders).
- [x] PC Vibration Settings menu row — ✅ CI APPLY-CONFIRMED (pre6 `27770729655`: succeeded). Only live anchor = resolver `Lqk8;->c0(Lkwj;,Leh3;,I)String`→`Ly99;->Z(Llok;,Lgm3;,I)String` (name c0→Z); runtime `maybeResolveCustomLabel` `Class.forName("vhg")`→`"o4h"` (field a). DONE both compile+runtime. ⚠️ DEVICE-VERIFY OWED.
- [x] Show Game ID menu row — ✅ AUTO-CLEARED (pre6: gone from SEVERE). 100% `if(false)` → was pure dependency-cascade on keystone+vibration; no own re-pin needed.
- [x] GOG menu row — ✅ AUTO-CLEARED (pre6: gone from SEVERE). 100% `if(false)` dependency-cascade.
- [x] Prefix API path with /v6 — dep #2; ⚠️ NOT a pure cascade — has its OWN broken fingerprints. ✅ RE-DERIVED + CI APPLY-CONFIRMED (run 27765728865) + ✅ **DEVICE-CONFIRMED 2026-06-18 (pre3 Normal, with #2):** URL_HELPER_CLASS `Ldva;`→**`Lscb;`**, URL_BUILDER_TYPE `Ljn9;`→**`Lfy9;`**, method `a` unchanged (smali_classes3/scb.smali `a(Lfy9;String)V` `.locals 3`, `iget-object p0, p0, Lfy9;->a:Lj5m;` then trim `Lkpk;->o1`; call site rpe.smali:227). Extension `V6PathPrefix` is pure string helper → NO runtime `Class.forName` stale risk.

### Applied clean on 6.0.9 (no action)
All privacy strips (Firebase/Crashlytics/GMS/MobPush/heartbeat/Ad-ID, Aliyun NumberAuth), audio, explore drawables/manifest/version-stamp, file-manager access, app-icon, external launcher, GameID label resource, local game-id assignment. Identical failure set across all 9 variants.

**Approach:** mirror `project_gamehub_608_patch_rederivation` re-pin method. Decompiles: `~/gh609-apktool-d` (apktool) + `~/gamehub-6.0.9-jadx` (jadx).

**After all 9 root re-pinned:** rewrite 608-specific release-notes prose in `release.yml` (vc119→121, voice-room narrative), then cut a real 609 build.

## 2026-07-29 — pre2: fixed startup crash (StripCloudGaming), re-delivered Genshin
pre1 Genshin crashed at launch: `MissingResourceException composeResources/com.xiaoji.egggame.features.cloud/values/strings.commonMain.cvr`. Root cause = `StripCloudGamingPatch`: its bytecode half SEVERE-failed on 6.1.0 (anchors gone) but its resource-delete DEPENDENCY (`stripCloudGamingResourcePatch`, no fingerprints) ran first and deleted the whole features.cloud asset module + Haima libs. On 6.1.0 features.cloud is loaded at STARTUP (was optional on 609) → crash. Lesson: a SEVERE-failed patch can still do damage via an already-executed resource dependency. Fix: `-d "Strip cloud gaming"` in release.yml (commit `77146c9`, with maintainer comment). pre2 run `30453222210` GREEN: `"Strip cloud gaming" disabled manually`, both pcengine patches `succeeded`, features.cloud restored (46 assets incl. the crash .cvr). Delivered `/sdcard/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.0.0-610-pre2-Patched-Genshin.apk`, md5 `ddf2021556a87aa1108bf7eff70772da`, cert `10895a31…894ce0ba`. ⏭️ StripCloudGaming needs proper 610 handling later (re-derive stubs OR re-scope to strip only the big cloud PNGs, never strings.commonMain.cvr).

## 2026-07-29 — pre3: THIRD signature gate found on-device (ComboLite install)
Device test of pre2 Genshin: signature bypass WORKED (journal failure changed `Verification`→`Install`; plugin downloads 22.7MB + passes our 2 gates). But install still failed. Live logcat capture (`:pcengine` pid, ComboLite logs to logcat+file) caught the real exception:
`java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Plugin signatures do not exactly match host signatures  at e43.q → ivi.D0 → ivi.H0 → ivi.C → PcEnginePluginHostService`.
= a THIRD signature check, HARD-CODED in ComboLite's InstallerManager (`ivi.D0(Application,PackageInfo,rti)V`), NOT gated by ValidationStrategy (so GATE 1/Insecure doesn't reach it), running at commit time in the `:pcengine` process. `ivi.D0` is a pure void validator (pkgid/metadata/schema/abi/host-sig-readable/plugin-sig-readable/**sig-match**, all via `e43.q(msg)` throw). Genuine plugin passes all but sig-match. **Fix = `PcEnginePluginInstallVerifyPatch`: force `ivi.D0` `return-void` at head** (anchored on the globally-unique English string). Also confirmed: **plugin resolves the RENAMED host fine** (`host AppRuntimeInfoHolder probe: ok … com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`) → the package-spoof caveat is NOT a problem; endpoint = `api-international-gamehub.xiaoji.com/game/mobile/v1/plugin/latest`. Building pre3 with all 3 patches.

## 2026-07-29 — pre3 GREEN + delivered (all 3 signature gates)
pre3 run built off `21f0939`. All three pcengine patches `succeeded` on Genshin (+ all variants): force Insecure validation / bypass manager signature check / bypass install-time signature check. Delivered `/sdcard/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.0.0-610-pre3-Patched-Genshin.apk`, md5 `6d8581b2955b41d61f78463cb6c981ae`, cert `10895a31…894ce0ba`. Same package/cert/versionCode as pre2 → installs in place over pre2 (keeps login + imported game). Awaiting device test: does the pcengine plugin now install + PC emulation launch, or is there a gate 4? Live-capture method ready (`bridge logcat -c` → nohup capture → retry → grep :pcengine).

## 2026-07-29 — ✅✅ WORKING: pcengine plugin installs + PC emulation launches on re-signed 6.1.0
Device-confirmed by user on pre3 (Genshin, cert 10895a31). Journal now shows `installedVersion` (versionName 100-1, vc100, abi arm64-v8a), NO failures. The 3-gate signature bypass is COMPLETE and device-proven — a re-signed BannerHub host loads XiaoJi's genuine ComboLite pcengine plugin.
- Real plugin CDN (resolved from /game/mobile/v1/plugin/latest): `https://gamehub-cdn.masnet.cn/uploads/plugin/20260729/<hash>.apk` (md5 0ab09364…, sha256 2457a32b…, 22761293 b). If we ever mirror/serve it, this is the artifact.
- THE RECIPE (3 patches, all in patches/gamehub/pcengine/, anchored on stable strings/non-obfuscated combo classes → survive R8 bumps):
  1. PcEngineValidationStrategyPatch — PluginFrameworkContext.getValidationStrategy() → Insecure.
  2. PcEnginePluginSignatureCheckPatch — pcengine manager check (Chinese "插件签名与宿主不一致"), force return null.
  3. PcEnginePluginInstallVerifyPatch — ComboLite ivi.D0 install validator (English "Plugin signatures do not exactly match host signatures"), force return-void. ← the decisive one; hard-coded, not gated by ValidationStrategy, runs in :pcengine at commit.
- No gate 4. Package-spoof is fine (plugin resolves renamed host). StripCloudGaming stays disabled on 610.
NEXT: merge feature/pcengine-signature-bypass → gamehub-610-build (device-proven). Then the rest of the 610 re-derivation (login/redirect/explore/keystone/etc.) + the deferred permission fix + proper StripCloudGaming 610 handling.

## 2026-07-29 — 📦 PRERELEASE cut: "GameHub 6.1.0 — PC-engine signature bypass (experimental)"
Tag `v1.0.0-610-pcengine` (run 30456383325 off gamehub-610-build `fade7c8`, stable=true then flipped). **prerelease=true, NOT Latest** (609 re-pinned as repo Latest). 13 assets: **9 APKs renamed to `Gamehub-v6.1.0-Patched-<variant>.apk`** (Normal/Original/PuBG/PuBG-CrossFire/AnTuTu/alt-AnTuTu/Ludashi/Genshin/Normal-GHL, all 56MB) + bh_explore.json + 3 .rvp. Rename done manually post-build (deleted BannerHub-V6-… assets, uploaded Gamehub-v6.1.0-… ; slow over link, per-file loop). Release notes rewritten for ACCURACY (user flag: not all 609 features carried over) — explains the 3 signature gates + why rename+testkey no longer works + honest works/doesn't-work (only pcengine sig-bypass + file access + external launcher + privacy strips work; login/catalog/explore/menus/GOG/steamchat NOT re-derived → still XiaoJi login/API). Also fixed: base-apk-609/610 were non-prerelease → base-apk-610 had stolen repo "Latest"; marked both prerelease + explicitly pinned v1.0.0-609 as Latest.

## 2026-07-29 — release finalized (identity + trim)
`v1.0.0-610-pcengine` updated in place (still prerelease, not Latest): title → "Gamehub 6.1.0 - Patched Performance Builds"; notes → collapsible <details> sections (NOT-BannerHub banner visible). App identity fixed (commit `0ffda36`): variant labels "BannerHub v6…"→"Gamehub <variant>" + disabled "Change app icon" (stock GameHub icon) — installed builds were showing BannerHub name+icon. Rebuilt artifacts-only (run 30463471453; a prior run 30461556813 hung 20min on the Gradle bundle step = transient runner, cancelled+re-ran). Verified: Genshin manifest android:label="Gamehub Genshin", "Change app icon" disabled in CI log. Assets trimmed to EXACTLY the 9 `Gamehub-v6.1.0-Patched-<variant>.apk` (deleted bh_explore.json + 3 .rvp). ~55MB each.

## 2026-07-29 — 🧭 610 PLAN OF RECORD + full static trace of the plugin-manifest chain
User approved building the "point 610 at our Worker" trio BEFORE the remaining re-derivation, then continuing with the normal patch re-derivation. Rationale: the manifest work is NOT in the 19-failure set (it's a new patch fingerprinted against 610 from scratch, so obfuscation drift can't have broken it), and it's the ONLY item that can degrade on upstream's schedule instead of ours — every current pre3 build reads XiaoJi's manifest to decide which engine to download.

### 🚨 THREE CORRECTIONS to the earlier plan (2 of them would have caused real damage)
1. **DO NOT retarget `pe0`'s host literals.** `pe0.a(String)` (smali_classes3/pe0.smali:54) builds `https://<host>/<path>` for the ENTIRE new 610 API surface — ~10 caller classes (`zy5, ffq, aos, gos, e2p, hos, zns, vdh, zot, zw3`) including login and profile. Swapping its 4 hosts would send all of it to our Worker and break the app. Earlier note ("a NEW patch retargeting pe0's host literal(s)") was WRONG.
2. **The correct patch is ONE inserted instruction**, thanks to an absolute-URL escape hatch: `kee.a(tgc,String)` uses the string verbatim (`h7r.b`) if it startsWith `http://`/`https://`, else appends it as a path. So at `smali_classes2/zy5.smali` — `:360 const-string v1,"game/mobile/v1/plugin/latest"` / `:364 invoke-static Lpe0;->a` / `:369 move-result-object v1` / `:372 new-instance v4,Lrk0;` — insert `const-string v1,"<absolute worker URL>"` right AFTER `move-result-object v1`. Zero removals, pe0 untouched, nothing else redirected. (Can't delete the invoke — move-result-object must directly follow it. v1 is not read again until the `kee.c` call at :474, so the clobber is safe.)
3. **The wire DTO is NOT `PcEnginePluginVersion`.** `tvi`/`rvi` (14 camelCase fields: channel/rolloutPercent/forceUpdate/min-maxHostVersionCode/notes) is the INTERNAL descriptor. The server sends the **8-field snake_case `PcEnginePluginUpdateDataDto`** (`mvi`, serializer `kvi`, keys literal-verified in kvi.smali:50-116), all 8 optional: `update_type, plugin_name("pcengine", hard-coded in mvi's secondary ctor), plugin_version, schema_version (String, not int!), apk_url, md5, sha256, file_size(Long)`. No rollout/forceUpdate/version-window on the wire — client-side defaults. Envelope = `BaseResult{code, msg(@JsonNames "message"), time, data}` (a62.smali:29).

### Request shape + success code — both pinned statically
GET (zy5.smali:474 calls `kee.c` → `dgc.b`; `dgc.<clinit>` proves b=GET, c=POST), query params added by `rk0`: `plugin_name`/`schema_version`/`plugin_version`; arg order = `zy5.a(pluginName, schemaVersion, pluginVersion, cont)`. Client validates `^[a-f0-9]{64}$` sha256 / `^[a-f0-9]{32}$` md5; errors "Empty response body" / "Body is not JSON". **Success code = 200, msg "Success"** — bannerhub-worker.js already answers this same BaseResult class that way for 6.0.x clients, so no upstream capture was needed.

### Anchors verified unique on 610 → both patches go structural (no more R8 letters)
- `smali_classes3/f7n.smali` is the ONLY class with BOTH catalog hosts (cn :39→v5, oversea :43→v6; Online first, Beta :75/:79; 6-arg `<init>`). ⇒ replace RedirectCatalogApiPatch's hardcoded `ENV_ENUM_CLASS` (7 re-pins to date: mcj/zhj/xrj/esj/nnh/qnh/yei) with the structural anchor its own comment already documents → bump-proof.
- `game/mobile/v1/plugin/latest` occurs in exactly ONE class (`zy5`).

### Worker-side recon
Worker = `bannerhub-worker.js` at the bannerhub-api repo root (1,670 lines; NOT src/index.ts, which is the static-JSON generator). `/v6/` prefix stripped at :853 setting `is60` ⇒ sending the manifest request to `…/v6/game/mobile/v1/plugin/latest` makes it v6-gated for free, which is why the patch's URL includes /v6/. 🚨 The route MUST be registered BEFORE the generic fall-through proxy (unallowlisted paths → `GAMEHUB_API = https://landscape-api.vgabc.com`, :2), or the new path gets proxied to the old catalog host which has never heard of it. Deploy = manual CF REST, `main` branch only, and is GATED on explicit user go-ahead (paid + outward-facing).

### Device-test success criterion (already known from pre3)
XiaoJi's live artifact resolves to `https://gamehub-cdn.masnet.cn/uploads/plugin/20260729/<hash>.apk`, md5 `0ab09364…`. Ours is md5 `a07d9ef8…` / sha256 `ad27bbc2…` / 22,765,391 b. So after the redirect: **md5 a07d9ef8… = our Worker won; 0ab09364… = it didn't.** Ground truth stays `pc_engine_plugin_manager_journal.json` (installedVersion 100-1, no failures). Our plugin is v6-signed so the cert matches natively — the 3 bypass patches become redundant seatbelts.

### 13-item plan of record
Phase A: (1) repair Redirect catalog API structurally · (2) repair Prefix API path /v6 · (3) NEW pcengine manifest redirect · (4) Worker route, code-only, deploy gated · (5) CI build + device-test the trio.
Phase B: (6) Bypass login + Debug logging [mandated first; the 3 Class.forName constants aren't apply-time validated] · (7) Explore hijack · (8) menu-id keystone → unblocks 5 menu rows · (9) remainder incl. privacy re-audit vs 610's new multi-OEM push stack · (10) cleanly disable the 2 dropped patches (offline picker, perf overlay — anchors are plugin-side now; remember pre1's lesson that a SEVERE-failed patch can still damage via an already-run resource dependency).
Phase C: (11) deferred push.permission.MESSAGE one-liner [MUST precede any multi-variant release] · (12) proper StripCloudGaming 610 handling · (13) silent base-bump chores (BADGE_BRANCH, 2 README raw URLs, release.yml tagging the default branch).

## 2026-07-29 — ✅ Phase A built: both API redirects re-derived STRUCTURALLY + pcengine manifest redirect + Worker route
Commits: this repo `630f301` · bannerhub-api `8b1b5a2` (main). CI run `30503506055`, headSha `630f3013` == pushed SHA (verified), label `1.0.0-610-pre4`, artifact-only.

### 🚨 update_type MUST be "plugin" — the trap that would have faked a redirect failure
`xy5.i(...)` at smali_classes2/xy5.smali:14042 reads `mvi.a` (`update_type`) → maps to enum `qvi` = **App/Plugin/Unknown** → branches on `.ordinal()`:
- `"app"` → App → the APP-update path (do NOT send)
- `"plugin"` → Plugin → ordinal 1 → `:cond_19` = the plugin-install path
- anything else **including the serializer default `""`** → Unknown → ordinal 2 → bails, **installs nothing**
Inside `:cond_19` it then **equality-checks `plugin_name` and `schema_version`** and returns early on mismatch. So `update_type:"plugin"` + `plugin_name:"pcengine"` + `schema_version:"1"` (a STRING) are hard requirements. Serving the DTO defaults would have looked exactly like "the redirect didn't work" on device.

### Both redirects now structural — no R8 letters left to re-pin
- **Redirect catalog API** → the unique `<clinit>` carrying BOTH `landscape-api-{cn,oversea}.vgabc.com`. Ends 7 bumps of letter chasing (mcj→zhj→xrj→esj→nnh→qnh→yei→f7n).
- **Prefix API path /v6** → the only **static (builder, String) -> void** method carrying BOTH `"http://"` and `"https://"`, which is what the helper structurally IS (the one place deciding absolute-vs-relative). Measured: 33 classes have `"https://"`, 15 have both, exactly **1 method** matches the full shape = `kee.a(Ltgc;Ljava/lang/String;)V`. Framework-typed first params excluded so `com.xiaomi.push.service.x`'s three `(Context,String)V` helpers can't match. History: zdb→ohb→vob→cpb→zua→dva→scb→**kee**.
- **NEW Redirect PC engine plugin manifest** → anchored on the endpoint path literal (globally unique to `zy5`). ONE inserted `const-string` after `move-result-object`; invoke/move-result deliberately left intact (move-result-object must directly follow its invoke). ⛔ Explicitly NOT a `pe0` host rewrite — `pe0.a()` serves the whole new 6.1.0 API surface (~10 callers incl. login/profile). URL hardcodes `/v6/` so it's Worker-gated independent of the prefix patch, and the prefix patch passes absolute URLs through untouched ⇒ they compose in any combination.
- CI enables patches by default (`-d` opt-outs, `-e` for parameterized) ⇒ the new patch needed no registration.

### Worker
`/game/mobile/v1/plugin/latest` added ABOVE the fall-through proxy (verified by char offset: 48703 < 90128) returning `{code:200,msg:'Success',time,data:{…8 snake_case fields…}}` from a documented `PCENGINE_PLUGIN` constant. `node --check` clean. Asset verified: release `pcengine-plugin-610` non-draft, `state=uploaded`, download URL **200 anonymously** through GitHub's redirect chain (client's HttpURLConnection follows redirects). ⛔ **NOT DEPLOYED** — CF deploy is manual/paid/gated, so the live Worker still lacks the route. The device test cannot pass until it's deployed.

### Default branch → gamehub-610-build (user request)
Matters because `release.yml` tags the DEFAULT branch, so cuts will now tag 610 (still verify headSha after every cut). Repointed in the same commit: `BADGE_BRANCH` (was still 609 — the exact silent rot that froze badges at "0" for 6 weeks), the 2 README badge raw URLs, the README build instruction, and release.yml's 5 blob/tree doc links.
⚠️ **release.yml's release-notes PROSE is still entirely 609** and would publish false claims on a 610 cut (:314 "a patched build of GameHub 6.0.9", :350 claims the menu chain was re-derived, :359 claims the full v6 feature set is device-verified incl. the offline picker + perf overlay we're dropping, :385 "unmodified 6.0.9 versionCode 121"). Left alone deliberately — that's a rewrite, not a find-and-replace, and the honesty bar from the pre3 notes applies.

## 2026-07-29 — ✅ run 30503506055 GREEN: all 3 redirect patches applied on all 9 variants
`Redirect catalog API` 9x · `Prefix API path with /v6` 9x · `Redirect PC engine plugin manifest` 9x.
**SEVERE 19 → 17, and that reconciles exactly:** only 2 of the original 19 were repairs (catalog + prefix); the manifest redirect was net-new and never in the failure set. So the earlier "19 minus 3" framing was wrong — 17 is the correct expected number, not an anomaly.
Remaining 17: Bypass login, Debug logging, Explore tab hijack, Per-game menu id capture (shared), Show Game ID menu row, Show PC Game Settings row, GOG menu row, Banner Tools menu row, PC Vibration Settings menu row, Stub analytics events, Disable heartbeat, Disable Firebase auto-init, Recording-compatible audio, PC-accurate vibration, In-game Steam chat overlay, + the 2 DROP-list entries (In-game performance overlay, Offline component picker — local list) which are not re-derivation targets.
⚠️ **"Applied" ≠ "works".** Apply-time success only proves the anchors matched and the emitted bytecode is valid. In particular the pcengine manifest redirect CANNOT be device-tested yet: the CF Worker deploy is still pending/gated, so the live Worker does not serve `/game/mobile/v1/plugin/latest` — a patched build would get no manifest and install no engine. Order is: deploy the Worker, THEN device-test.

## 2026-07-30 — 🟢 Worker DEPLOYED (deployment `b9b81005924f474287b26a8d4b74b449`) — device test now unblocked
Deployed the pcengine-manifest route to the live bannerhub-api Worker, with guardrails. **All checks green.**

### 🔴 The guardrail that mattered: bindings were 6, not 3
The 77-day-old worker memory listed 3 bindings. Live read showed **6**: `kv_namespace/TOKEN_STORE`, `r2_bucket/CHAT_IMAGES` (bucket `bannerhub-chat-images`), and 4 `secret_text` (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `TURN_API_TOKEN`, `TURN_KEY_ID`). Deploying from the remembered list would have **dropped R2 chat-images + both TURN secrets** → broken chat images and broken voice calls for every existing user. Working metadata: declare `kv_namespace` + `r2_bucket` explicitly, `"keep_bindings":["secret_text"]` carries the 4 secrets; pass `compatibility_date`/`compatibility_flags` matching live, omit `usage_model`. **Verified before==after: all 6 preserved.**

### Drift check
Live script == repo `0f393a8` **byte-for-byte** after stripping CF's multipart envelope (GET returns the script wrapped: boundary + `Content-Disposition` + blank at top, blank + closing boundary at bottom — strip or you see phantom drift) and normalizing the trailing newline. So no live/repo divergence this time (the old `master`-5KB-ahead class of bug, fixed in `3df6494`), and the deploy added only the additive route.

### Rollback (durable, outside /tmp)
`/data/data/com.termux/files/home/worker-backups/20260730-pcengine-route/` — `ROLLBACK.sh` (executable, re-declares all 6 bindings), `rollback-bannerhub-worker.js` (`cmp`-verified identical to pre-deploy live), `metadata.json`, `settings.json` / `settings-after.json`, `deploy-response.json`.

### Post-deploy verification
- Existing routes all 200: `/v6/simulator/v2/getImagefsDetail` (1.4.2 reshaped), bare `/simulator/v2/getImagefsDetail` (static passthrough — **different shape, version gate intact**), `/v6/simulator/v2/getContainerList`, `/base/getBaseInfo`, `/devices/getDevicesList`, `/chat/rooms`.
- New route passes all 10 client-contract checks: `code:200`, `msg`, `time`, `update_type:"plugin"`, `plugin_name:"pcengine"`, `schema_version:"1"` (STRING), md5 `^[a-f0-9]{32}$`, sha256 `^[a-f0-9]{64}$`, `file_size` int, https `apk_url`.
- Prior builds are structurally unable to reach the new code: the path is 6.1.0-only, exact-match, and the change was 70 insertions / 0 deletions.

⏭️ NEXT: device-test pre4 (run 30503506055). Success criterion = the installed plugin's md5 is **a07d9ef8…** (ours) not **0ab09364…** (XiaoJi's); ground truth `pc_engine_plugin_manager_journal.json` shows installedVersion 100-1 with no failures. Per the DEBUG RULE, verify the installed APK's sha256 against the staged build first.

## 2026-07-30 — 🎯 SCOPE CHANGE: the 610 line is full BannerHub v6 again (commit `cbd2fc1`)
User: *"we were only making this for the community to have a working vanilla gamehub with performance package names, this is work to build a full bannerhub v6 again now."*
So the GameHub-identity framing from `0ffda36` is retired. Reversed its identity half: 9 variant labels `"Gamehub …"` → `"BannerHub v6 …"`, and **`Change app icon` re-enabled** (adaptive icon, Wine container header, auth/splash). `-d "Strip cloud gaming"` stays — still genuinely broken on 6.1.0. (The lone remaining "Change app icon" hit in release.yml is the docs table at :404, not a flag.)
**Consequences:** the re-derivation backlog is now REQUIRED rather than optional · the deferred `push.permission.MESSAGE` fix is genuinely blocking again (multi-variant BannerHub releases are back) · release-notes prose needs BannerHub framing restored *on top of* the 609→610 rewrite it already needed.
⚠️ pre4 (run 30503506055) predates this commit → those APKs still show stock GameHub icon + "Gamehub <variant>" label. Cosmetic only; does not affect the manifest-redirect test.

### Staged for device test (both from run 30503506055, cert `10895a31…894ce0ba`)
| variant | file | md5 | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Genshin | `/sdcard/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.0.0-610-pre4-Patched-Genshin.apk` | `57e322fc11b9ce860edde557d00656dc` | ✅ **use this** — pkg `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact` is free, clean install, no plugin state ⇒ guaranteed to exercise our manifest endpoint |
| Normal | `/sdcard/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.0.0-610-pre4-Patched-Normal.apk` | `c895052cfbf0ce6f6fbc33277726deb6` | ⛔ **do not install** — `banner.hub` already installed at vc78 / 145 MB signed with the **AOSP testkey** (`a40da80a…`), not our v6 key ⇒ cert mismatch, install refuses; would need uninstalling that app and losing its data |

Per-artifact dex verification (both variants): our manifest URL PRESENT · worker host PRESENT · `pe0` host PRESENT (untouched by design) · Online-enum `landscape-api-cn.vgabc.com` ABSENT (replaced) · Beta-enum hosts PRESENT (kept on purpose).
Device state at staging time: `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact` and `com.xiaoji.egggame` NOT installed (pre3 Genshin and the stock 6.1.0 are both gone); `gamehub.lite` installed at vc121 (a 609 build); no pcengine plugin state under either installed package.

## 2026-07-30 — 🐛 "Failed to install the PC engine plugin" — latent manifest bug found + fixed; pre5 staged
User screenshot (21:09, AIO-Graphics-Test-32bit in Library) showed the toast **"Failed to install the PC engine plugin."** App was uninstalled before I could read live state, so this was diagnosed statically.

### Root cause found in the bytecode: the manifest reply must ECHO the request
`xy5.i(...)` calls `zy5.a(pluginName, schemaVersion, pluginVersion, cont)` to fetch the manifest, then — after mapping `update_type` to the App/Plugin/Unknown enum and taking the Plugin branch (`:cond_19`) — compares the RESPONSE's `plugin_name` (`mvi.b`) and `schema_version` (`mvi.d`) against **the very registers it passed as request arguments**, not against constants. Mismatch ⇒ silent bail ⇒ exactly this toast, with nothing pointing at the manifest.
Our Worker HARDCODED `plugin_name:"pcengine"` / `schema_version:"1"`, which only works if those are the exact wire values the client sends. **Fix: echo both back from the query string**, keeping the constants as fallback for manual curls. Commit `27dfd27`, deployed `48eb38f730084b679e47cc1653d0a580`.
Verified live: `?plugin_name=ZZZTEST&schema_version=9` → echoed verbatim; `?plugin_name=com.xiaoji.egggame.plugin.pcengine` → echoed verbatim; no params → falls back to defaults. `time` increments between calls (not cached). **All 6 bindings preserved**; existing routes (`/v6/` + bare 5.x imagefs, chat, baseInfo) still 200. Rollback at `worker-backups/20260730-echo-params/`.
⚠️ Honest caveat: this is a REAL bug that produces this exact symptom, but it is not yet PROVEN to be the one the user hit. Other candidates remain (download/redirect failure, ComboLite install). Needs the live capture below.

### Device findings while triaging
- `com.xiaoji.egggame.plugin.pcengine` is installed as a **standalone app** (vc100, versionName 100-1, installed 2026-07-29 08:31) — a leftover from the pre3 plugin-retrieval work. ComboLite loads from `files/plugin_packages/`, not from an installed package, so it shouldn't matter, but it's noise: **recommend uninstalling before the next test.**
- `com.miHoYo.Yuanshen` (vc32208010) is the REAL Genshin game, NOT our variant — our Genshin variant is `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`, so no collision. But `com.antutu.ABenchMark` IS installed (vc1, the real AnTuTu) and **does** collide with our AnTuTu variant package.
- ⚠️ `bridge` returns inconsistent/empty results for multi-package `dumpsys` loops — use one simple command per call.

### pre5 built + staged (run 30504941894, sha 1248e090 == HEAD)
GREEN. `Redirect catalog API` / `Prefix API path with /v6` / `Redirect PC engine plugin manifest` / **`Change app icon`** all 9x. SEVERE still 17.
`/sdcard/Download/BannerHub-V6-1.0.0-610-pre5-Patched-Genshin.apk` — md5 `352ecc2e36755082b478b2b9eb92717a`, 58,940,295 b, cert `10895a31…894ce0ba`, manifest URL confirmed present in dex. This one carries the restored BannerHub icon + "BannerHub v6 Genshin" label.

### 🆕 6.1.0 GUEST MODE — built-in login bypass (new, absent in 609)
String `android_features_auth_guest_mode_entry` = 游客模式，先体验一下 ("Guest mode, try it first", id 0x7f110032) + drawable `android_features_auth_ic_guest_entry`. Built programmatically in `mi.b(...)` (`smali_classes2/mi.smali:298`) as a LinearLayout + icon + 14sp TextView, and **registered onto the Aliyun one-tap login screen** via `com.mobile.auth.gatewayauth.PhoneNumberAuthHelper` + `AuthRegisterViewConfig$Builder` (mi.smali:23/206/210). Click handler `Lii;` invokes a caller-supplied `Function0`, checks its Boolean, may Toast, then continues via `mi.c(...)`. Callers: `li.smali:1265`, `:2443`; other refs `bgp.smali`, `smali_classes3/i27.smali`.
🚨 **CONFLICT: guest mode is rendered BY the Aliyun NumberAuth SDK, which our privacy suite stubs.** One of the 5 still-applying manifest-level privacy patches targets Aliyun NumberAuth — if that SDK is neutered the guest entry may never render, i.e. our own privacy hardening could destroy the built-in login bypass. Verify before assuming guest mode can retire the "Bypass login" patch.

## 2026-07-30 — 🎯 ROOT CAUSE: `plugin_version` must be the numeric version CODE (device-diagnosed, fixed, deployed)
pre5 install hash-verified as the installed APK (`9b2ed055…` == staged) per the DEBUG RULE, then the journal gave the answer outright — 9 identical entries:
`{"kind":"Verification","message":"服务端插件版本号不合法: 100-1"}` = **"server plugin version number is invalid: 100-1"**.

**Cause:** the client runs Kotlin **`toLongOrNull()` on `plugin_version`** (`xy5.smali:14181`, at `:cond_1b` — reached only after the `plugin_name` and `schema_version` equality checks PASS, which incidentally proves the echo fix was working). The plugin's versionName `100-1` is not Long-parseable; its versionCode is `100`. **Fix = `plugin_version:"100"`.** bannerhub-api `2e3de83`, deploy `0a86fe8b343e4cd99a593f8bb6aecd29`, rollback `worker-backups/20260730-version-code-fix/`, all 6 bindings preserved, live reply verified to parse as a Long.

**It was never a signing / download / which-APK problem.** The client bailed during manifest validation and never attempted a download — so the user's suggestion of also hosting the original re-signed plugin to "see which one gets through" would have failed identically for both copies. Worth remembering: the toast is generic and names nothing, so **read the journal, never guess from the toast.**

### 📜 Full manifest-validation contract discovered in xy5.smali (use this before inventing field values)
| line | message (translated) | requirement |
|---|---|---|
| :24584 | server plugin name mismatch, **expected `pcengine`**, actual … | `plugin_name` literally `pcengine` |
| :24576 | server schemaVersion=… | `schema_version` must match what the client sent |
| :24580 | server plugin version number is invalid: … | `plugin_version` **Long-parseable** (version CODE) |
| :25142 | server did not return plugin download URL | `apk_url` non-empty |
| :25631 | server returned illegal SHA-256 | `^[a-f0-9]{64}$` |
| :25775 | server returned illegal MD5 | `^[a-f0-9]{32}$` |
Plus the `update_type` enum gate: `"plugin"` → Plugin branch; `""` or anything else → Unknown → silent no-op.

⏭️ No new APK needed — this was purely server-side. **Retest with the SAME installed pre5 build** (md5 `352ecc2e36755082b478b2b9eb92717a`). Success = journal shows `installedVersion` 100-1 with no failures, and the downloaded artifact's md5 is `a07d9ef8…` (ours) not `0ab09364…` (XiaoJi's).

## 2026-07-30 — ✅ OUR PLUGIN IS LIVE ON DEVICE + 🔴 catalog redirect proven INERT
### ✅ Phase A's actual goal achieved: patched 6.1.0 installs OUR engine, not XiaoJi's
Triple-confirmed on pre5 / `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact` (installed APK sha256 `9b2ed055…` == staged, per the DEBUG RULE):
1. journal `installedVersion.downloadUrl` = our GitHub release asset
2. journal `md5`/`lastUpdateMd5` = `a07d9ef8…` (ours), NOT `0ab09364…` (XiaoJi's `gamehub-cdn.masnet.cn` build)
3. on-disk bytes md5 = `a07d9ef8…`
Zero journal failures. 📌 The real install path is **`files/plugins/<id>/base.apk`** — `files/plugin_packages/<id>/` exists but is EMPTY, don't look there. Siblings: `pc_engine_active_plugin_identity`, `pc_engine_plugin_operation_results`, `pc_engine_plugin_recovery`, `plugins.xml`.

### 🔴 But the catalog redirect has NO runtime effect on 610 (user: no components under dxvk/vkd3d/GPU drivers)
- Device `shared_prefs/sp_winemu_unified_resources.xml` (454,344 b → `/sdcard/Download/reg610.xml`): **783 download URLs, ALL `uxdl.mac520.com`** (XiaoJi CDN) + 1 bigeyes.com, **ZERO github.com**.
- Our Worker is healthy and would be unmistakable: `/v6/simulator/v2/getAllComponentList` → **612 entries, ALL github.com**; the bare 5.x path → also ALL github.com. **No Worker path can produce `uxdl` URLs** ⇒ the app never asked us.
- 🔑 **Why the plugin manifest worked and this doesn't:** our manifest patch injects an **ABSOLUTE** URL, which `kee.a`'s `http(s)://` branch uses verbatim — bypassing base-URL resolution entirely. Catalog calls use **relative** paths and resolve against the HttpClient's base, which is still XiaoJi's. The absolute-URL trick was load-bearing, not incidental.
- **Ruled out:** wrong enum value (`f7n.f` IS active; `ne0.b` defaults to it; no `server_environment` override on device) · wrong fields (`f7n.<init>` iputs p3→a p4→b p5→c p6→d; the two vgabc literals load into v5/v6 ⇒ **c=cn host, d=oversea host**, exactly what we rewrite) · dead fields (they ARE read, in `ne0.b()` at `ne0.smali:399`/`:407`, selected by `kg0.a()`, called by `ne0.a()`; `ne0.a()` has 7 callers, `ne0.b()` 4).
- `ao4.smali` (holds the `simulator/v2/getAllComponentList` literal at :348) references **neither `pe0` nor `f7n`** — it routes through `kee`, whose client is `kee.a:Lvec;`.
⏭️ NEXT: locate where the Ktor client `Lvec;` gets its base URL (the DI `defaultRequest` config) and repoint it; or reuse the proven absolute-URL trick per catalog call site; or redirect `pe0` **selectively for allowlisted paths only** (never wholesale — it serves login/profile too). Also re-verify whether the `/v6` prefix patch does anything at runtime on 610, since our Worker's 6.x-vs-5.x branching depends on it.

## 2026-07-30 — 🎯 CATALOG ROOT CAUSE: it's fetched BY THE PLUGIN, so no host patch can reach it
Chased the base URL to the end. **The host is exonerated; the plugin owns the catalog.**

### Host side is definitively NOT the problem
- Exactly ONE base-URL source exists: `beh.smali:123` and `:164` set `mvq.d = ne0.a()` (sole reader `svq.smali:2247`). `ne0.a()` → `ne0.b()` → `f7n.c` (cn) / `f7n.d` (oversea) — **precisely the fields our Redirect-catalog patch rewrites.**
- `f7n.f` (= Online) IS the active env (`ne0.b` defaults to it), and there's no `server_environment` override in the app's data.
- So the host's base URL genuinely IS our Worker after patching. The catalog simply never goes through it.
- Tell: `ao4` passes a **relative** path to `kee.c`, whereas `zy5` (plugin manifest) passed `pe0.a(...)`'s **absolute** URL. That asymmetry is exactly why only the manifest redirect took effect.

### The plugin has its own catalog client
`/sdcard/Download/pcengine-100-1-decompiled` contains **all** the catalog endpoints — including the 4 that "vanished" from the host: `simulator/v2/{getAllComponentList,getComponentList,getContainerList,getDefaultComponent}` and `simulator/executeScript`, plus configList/shareConfig/getTabList/getGameLoadingPromptList — **and its own host literals**: `landscape-api-{cn,oversea}.vgabc.com`, `landscape-api-{beta,cn-beta,oversea-beta}.vgabc.com`, `api-{cn,international}-gamehub.xiaoji.com`, `clientgsw.vgabc.com`, `dev2-*`, `statistic-gamehub-api.vgabc.com`. It runs in `:pcengine`, shares the app data dir, and writes `sp_winemu_unified_resources.xml` itself — hence 783 uxdl URLs and zero github.
⇒ Earlier note that those 4 endpoints "moved into the plugin with the launch path" was right; the consequence — that the catalog redirect becomes unreachable — wasn't drawn.

### 🔑 The fix: we own the artifact, so patch the plugin too
Rewrite the plugin's `landscape-api-{cn,oversea}.vgabc.com` → `bannerhub-api.the412banner.workers.dev`, `apktool b`, re-sign with the v6 keystore, re-upload to release `pcengine-plugin-610`, update the Worker's `PCENGINE_PLUGIN` md5/sha256/fileSize.
⚠️ Solve first: (1) **re-download won't trigger on the same version** — device has vc100 and the client compares the manifest's Long-parseable `plugin_version` against it; bumping to "101" while the APK declares vc100 may fail a consistency check, so bump both or clear plugin state. (2) The plugin won't send the **`/v6` prefix**, and our Worker gates the 6.x reshape + EnvListData wrapper on `is60` — without it the plugin gets 5.x-shaped JSON that 6.1.0's kotlinx-strict parser may reject (same class as the historical EnvListData bug). (3) Confirm which of the plugin's many hosts actually serve the catalog before rewriting; leave beta/dev/statistic alone.

## 2026-07-30 — 🏁 PHASE A COMPLETE, FULLY DEVICE-PROVEN: patched 610 runs OUR engine AND OUR catalog
User confirmed GPU drivers / DXVK / VKD3D visible. Verified objectively on device:
| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| installed engine md5 | `a07d9ef8…` (our unpatched build) | **`ee4bae17…` (catalog-patched)** |
| component download hosts | **783 `uxdl.mac520.com`, 0 ours** | **1240 `github.com`, 0 XiaoJi** |
Both hops work: host → our Worker for the engine manifest; engine → our Worker for the catalog. 🎉 **The feared reply-shape problem did NOT materialize** — our existing `/v6` 6.x reshape + EnvListData wrapper satisfies the 6.1.0 plugin's parser unchanged, so zero server-side format work was needed.

### 🔧 Plugin-patch recipe (reuse on every plugin re-derivation)
1. Decompile source: `pcengine-work/pcengine-100-1-decompiled`; copy to a build dir.
2. Patch `smali/xjp/bp6.smali` (plugin env enum). `<init>(I,String,String,String,String)` iputs p3→a p4→b p5→c ⇒ **a = env key, b = cn host, c = oversea host**. Rewrite ONLY the Online value's hosts (lines 37/41) → `bannerhub-api.the412banner.workers.dev/v6`; leave Beta (69/73) and Test/dev2 (101/105). Readers: `xjp/ba.b()` (`ba.smali:532`/`:540`), consumed by `ba.a()` which concatenates `scheme://host+suffix` with a StringBuilder — which is why the inline `/v6` works.
3. ⛔ **`apktool b` FAILS under PRoot** — aapt2 exits **132 (SIGILL)** on resources. But apktool emits `build/apk/classes*.dex` before failing, so **repack by swapping ONLY the dex into a copy of the original APK** (python `zipfile`, preserve each entry's `compress_type`/`external_attr`, drop `META-INF/*.{SF,RSA,DSA,MF}`), then sign with `apksigner.jar`.
4. ⚠️ Therefore **versionCode/versionName stay 100 / "100-1"** — the manifest is never rebuilt. An installed device will NOT treat it as an update, and the Worker's `plugin_version` must NOT go above 100 while the APK says 100. Force a re-fetch by **uninstalling the app** (installing over the top keeps the old engine and changes nothing) or deleting `files/plugins/` + the journal.
5. Update the Worker's `PCENGINE_PLUGIN` apkUrl/md5/sha256/fileSize, deploy, verify.

Artifact: `pcengine-100-1-bannerhub-v6-catalog.apk`, 23,494,479 b, md5 `ee4bae17…`, sha256 `1f381ba7…`, cert `10895a31…`, on release `pcengine-plugin-610` beside the unpatched one (kept as fallback). Worker deploy `86cc1799118f4967b8207d337bcbdc4a`, bannerhub-api `e8ff3cf`. Worker also normalizes duplicate slashes + accepts bare `/v6` (verified `/v6/`, `/v6//`, `/v6///`).

⏭️ Phase A closed. Next per the plan: task 6 (Bypass login + Debug logging) — but first check task 16, since 6.1.0's built-in guest mode may retire the login patch outright (caveat: it renders via the Aliyun NumberAuth SDK our privacy suite stubs). Also still owed: task 11 (`push.permission.MESSAGE`, now genuinely blocking since the line is full BannerHub v6 again), task 15 (release-notes rewrite), task 17 (610 master map).

## 2026-07-30 — 🔍 Guest-mode investigation COMPLETE. Verdict: do NOT rely on it; keep re-deriving `Bypass login`.
Traced the whole chain statically:
1. **Gate** (`smali/xi.smali:680-716`): passed to `li.a(F,Z,Z)` as p3 = *"NOT already-logged-in AND NOT `auth_has_logged_in_before`"* (`xdn.a(key,false)`). ⇒ **only ever offered to a never-logged-in install**; after one successful login the pref flips and the entry is gone permanently.
2. **Render** (`mi.b`, `mi.smali:298`): programmatic LinearLayout + guest icon + 14sp TextView (`游客模式，先体验一下`), registered onto the **Aliyun one-tap login screen** via `PhoneNumberAuthHelper` + `AuthRegisterViewConfig$Builder` (rootViewId `0x12b`).
3. **Tap** (`ii.smali`): invokes `Function0` = `fi(Ref$BooleanRef, mode 3)` whose `invoke()` just returns `Ref$BooleanRef.element` — the **"I agree to the terms" checkbox**. False ⇒ Toast + abort.
4. **Action** (`mi.c`, `:680`): debounce, `setAuthListener`, `mi.d()` dismisses the Aliyun page, then `tryEmit(new qi())` where **`qi` = `GuestModeClick(agreedChecked=true)`** (implements `ti`; siblings `oi`=`Canceled`, `pi`=`Error`).
5. **Handler** (`o3.emit`, `smali_classes3/o3.smali:6443`): analytics (`sqb("domestic"|"overseas")` → `bju.A` — **that string is only an analytics label, NOT a region gate**), re-checks `rf1.k()` + `auth_has_logged_in_before`, then updates auth UI state via `ei.a(...)` on a `MutableStateFlow`.

**Why it can't replace our patch:** (a) conditional — pre-first-login only, whereas ours must work unconditionally; (b) 🚨 it is drawn *by* the Aliyun SDK our privacy suite stubs, so enabling one likely disables the other — we'd be trading a privacy patch for a login bypass; (c) it emits a UI-state signal, not a session — nothing mints credentials, so there's no equivalent of the FakeStateFlow/FakeUserAccount/FakeAuthToken fakes our patch installs.
✅ Not region-gated, so it is a real upstream feature.
⏭️ Only open question needs a DEVICE test, not more smali: on a fresh never-logged-in install of our build, does the entry appear and does the resulting state allow library + add-local-game? Cheap to fold into the next clean install. Treat as a bonus, never a dependency.

⏭️ NEXT: task 6 — re-derive `Bypass login` + `Debug logging` (shared GAME_LIB_REPO anchor). 15 patches to re-derive, 2 to disable.

## 2026-07-30 — 🔑 Group A (Bypass login + Debug logging): 610 auth letter map, partially derived
The auth layer was **restructured on 6.1.0**, not merely re-lettered. Verified in `~/gh610-apktool-d`:
| role | 6.0.9 | **6.1.0** | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| AUTH_INTERFACE | `Lrx0;` | **`Lrf1;`** | `smali_classes3/rf1.smali:1`; 6 StateFlow getters `b/f/h/l/m/n` + defaults `c()Z k()Z d()Lhfr; i()Lpfr;` |
| AUTH_IMPL | `Lux0;` | **`Lyf1;`** | `yf1.smali:6` implements `Lrf1;`; 4 StateFlow + 4 MutableStateFlow fields; ctor `(Ludr;Lqg1;Lui0;Lxdn;)V` takes the AuthTokenDao |
| AUTH_TOKEN | `Lqbm;` | **`Lpfr;`** = `UserToken` | 10 fields `(S,S,S,S,Long,Long,J,Z,J,J)`, **`.a` = userId** — same shape as 609, so the patch's field assumption holds |
| user model | — | **`Lhfr;`** = `UserProfile` | `.a` = userId |
| isLoggedIn | `a()Z` | **`k()Z`** (reads `l()`) | `rf1.smali:117`; corroborated by the guest-mode gate using `rf1.k()` |
| other bool | — | `c()Z` (reads `m()`) | `rf1.smali:13` — NOT the login flag |
| token getter | `f()` | **`i()Lpfr;`** (reads `f()`) | `rf1.smali:87` |
| user getter | `e()` | **`d()Lhfr;`** (reads `h()`) | `rf1.smali:48` |
| AuthTokenDao | — | **`Lqg1;`** | ctor `(RoomDatabase)`, ops on `Lrg1;` |
| AuthTokenEntity | — | **`Lrg1;`** | 11 fields, `a`=id(J), **`b`=userId** — note the DOMAIN token uses `.a` for userId, the ENTITY uses `.b`; don't mix them up |

### Two findings that change the patch itself, not just its constants
1. 🔑 **StateFlow is now the REAL `kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlow`/`MutableStateFlow`**, not an obfuscated wrapper. The whole reason `FakeStateFlow.java` used reflection on 6.0.x was to build a host-compatible flow without growing `.locals`; on 610 we can likely use `MutableStateFlow` directly, making its 3 obfuscated letter constants unnecessary. Verify before rewriting.
2. 🚨 **NEW DECORATOR `Llm;`** — also implements `Lrf1;` and holds `a:Lrf1;`, i.e. it wraps another auth interface. **Trap:** if consumers get `lm` rather than `yf1`, patching `yf1`'s getters is bypassed — precisely the "applies but does nothing" failure we already hit with the catalog redirect. Must determine which is injected before trusting the map.

⏭️ Still to derive: GAME_LIB_REPO + its no-arg String userId getter (609 `Lqv7;`/`h()`), NAVIGATOR + its 2 login gates (609 `Ljrd;`/`i`+`s`), and which of `yf1`/`lm` is injected. Then DebugLogPatch (shares these anchors).

### 🤖 5 grouped subagents launched in parallel (user-approved) to derive the other patch clusters
B menu keystone + 5 rows · C analytics/privacy (+ audit of 6.1.0's NEW multi-OEM push stack) · D Explore tab hijack · E audio + vibration (incl. a feasibility verdict on PC-accurate vibration now that container ownership moved into the plugin) · F Steam chat overlay. Grouped by SHARED ANCHOR rather than one-per-patch, because the 5 menu rows all cascade off the keystone and login/debug share the auth map — per-patch agents would have re-derived the same classes repeatedly. All are briefed to return letter maps + proposed edits ONLY (no commits), and to state whether each anchor is still actually REACHED at runtime, given the catalog-redirect lesson that CI success proves nothing.

## 2026-07-30 — ✅ Group A auth letter map COMPLETE (Bypass login + Debug logging)
Remaining anchors resolved, all verified by reading 6.1.0 smali bodies:
| role | 6.0.9 | **6.1.0** | anchor |
|---|---|---|---|
| GAME_LIB_REPO | `Lqv7;` | **`Lp5a;`** | `p5a.smali:134` ctor `(GameLibraryDatabase;Lrf1;Liwi;)V` — **`GameLibraryDatabase` is UNOBFUSCATED ⇒ permanent structural anchor**; field `b:Lrf1;` unchanged |
| userId method | `h()` | **`h()` UNCHANGED** | `p5a.smali:11370`: `iget b:Lrf1;` → `Lrf1;->i()Lpfr;` → `Lpfr;->a:String`. Independently confirms `i()`=token getter, `pfr.a`=userId |
| NAVIGATOR | `Ljrd;` | **`Lfch;`** | `fch.smali:35` ctor `(Landroidx/navigation3/runtime/NavBackStack;Lrf1;…)` — **`NavBackStack` UNOBFUSCATED ⇒ permanent structural anchor** |
| nav login gates | `i`+`s`, 1 each | **`i(Lw01;)V` 1 gate @1601 · `j(Lw01;)Z` TWO gates @1792 + @1845** | 3 call sites of `Lrf1;->k()Z` |
| impl isLoggedIn flow | `h()` | **`yf1.l()`** → field `e` | `yf1.smali:683` |
| impl user flow | `e()` | **`yf1.h()`** → field `b` | `yf1.smali:645` |
| impl token flow | — | **`yf1.f()`** → field `c` | `yf1.smali:552` |
| impl other-bool flow | — | `yf1.m()` → field `d` (backs `c()`, NOT login) | `yf1.smali:694` |

✅ All four impl getters are the exact 2-instruction shape (`.locals 0` / iget-object p0 / return-object p0) the 609 patch already expects → the existing edit transfers unchanged.
✅ `yf1` does NOT override the interface defaults `c/d/i/k` (implements only a,b,e,f,g,h,j,l,m,n,o) → patching the impl's StateFlow getters propagates to `k()`/`d()`/`i()`; no need to patch both layers.
✅ **Decorator trap RESOLVED:** DI binds `Lrf1;`→**`Lyf1;`** (`ia4.smali:1040-1124`, `ha4.smali:618-622` build `new Lyf1;` under `const-class Lrf1;`). `Llm;` is constructed only inside abstract `Lbmr;:456-460` and is NOT the DI-bound impl ⇒ patching `yf1` is correct.
🚨 **NEW TRAP to encode in the patch:** 609's navigator loop was `listOf("i","s")` taking the FIRST `iget b` per method. On 610 `j()` has **TWO** gates, so first-match-only would silently leave one live — the exact "applies but doesn't work" shape we hit with the catalog redirect. Patch every `invoke-interface Lrf1;->k()Z` + `move-result` pair instead of anchoring on the iget; that's also polarity-agnostic (the 3 sites branch `if-eqz`, `if-nez`, `if-eqz`).
🎁 Two structural anchors are now available that can never be re-lettered: `GameLibraryDatabase` (repo) and `NavBackStack` (navigator). Use them instead of R8 letters.
⏭️ Next: write the patch edits; re-check whether `FakeStateFlow.java` can drop its reflection now that StateFlow is the real kotlinx type on 610; then `DebugLogPatch.kt` (shares these anchors).

## 2026-07-30 — ✅ Bypass login + Explore tab hijack APPLIED (9/9 each). SEVERE 17 → 15.
Run `30510645954` (sha `d27bafa`) green: `Bypass login` 9/9, `Explore tab hijack` 9/9. ⚠️ **APPLIED, not device-proven** — neither has been run on hardware.

### 🐛 My own bug, worth remembering: an anchor I called "permanent" wasn't unique
First attempt (`db718d3`) failed 9/9 with `Required value was null` — an error several steps from the cause. `GameLibraryDatabase` as first ctor param matches **8 classes** on 610 (aqb, bif, g1a, ic9, p5a, qhf, xf9, yhf); `firstMethod` bound to `aqb`, then found no userId getter there. The **(GameLibraryDatabase, AUTH_INTERFACE) PAIR** is what's unique. `NavBackStack` first-param genuinely is unique. Also: dexlib2 exposes `parameterTypes` as **CharSequence**, which never `==` a String literal — compare with `.toString()`. Fixed in `d27bafa`.

### What changed in Bypass login beyond letters
- Navigator gates are no longer edited call-site-by-call-site. 610 has **THREE** login checks (1 in `i()`, **2** in `j()`) vs one per method on 609, so the old first-match-per-method loop would have left one live. Now the shared `k()Z` interface default they all dispatch to is neutralized — one edit, covers all, polarity-agnostic, immune to new call sites. Kept alongside the `l()` StateFlow patch so either anchor alone holds.
- The token is faked at its StateFlow source (`yf1.f()`), which also covers direct collectors. The old `AUTH_INTERFACE."f"` edit was REMOVED — on 610 `f()` is the abstract StateFlow getter, so it would have targeted the wrong member.
- 🎁 `FakeStateFlow.java` **lost all 3 obfuscated constants** — `StateFlowKt.MutableStateFlow(Object)` survives R8 un-obfuscated.

### Explore tab hijack
Tab enum `Lrn9;`→`Lh5c;` (ordinals byte-identical). Also declared the `sharedGamehubExtensionPatch` dependency it always needed but never had — it worked only because another selected patch happened to bundle the extension, which on 610 (most bytecode patches failing) is exactly how you get "succeeded, runtime no-op".

### 🗺️ All 5 derivation agents returned — full map + traps recorded in memory `project_gamehub_610_rederivation_map`
**HEADLINE: 6.1.0 INVERTED its R8 keep-rules.** Compose/kotlin-functions/StringResource/DrawableResource/java.util.List/CollectionsKt/StringResourcesKt/kotlin.Lazy AND the whole coroutines+Flow ABI are now kept with REAL NAMES, while XiaoJi's own kept classes collapsed 1474 → 40. ⇒ most pinned letters in the remaining patches can become permanent FQNs. Side effect: the row-list `add` changed `invoke-virtual` → `invoke-interface`.
**Three NEW instances of "applies but never runs":** the host `GamepadServerManager.onRumble` is a dead stub (no libwinemu, zero callers, `close()` throws) · `WineActivity` is gone from the dex but survives as a manifest `<activity-alias>` (so grepping the manifest misleads you) · BannerTools has been injecting inside a **conditional branch since ≥6.0.9** (pre-existing latent bug).
**Landmine:** naively stubbing the remaining `heartbeat/game/start` gate would **ClassCastException at game launch** — it's a launch interceptor whose result is branched, not discarded.
**Free wins:** `GameIdDisplayMenuRowPatch` + `GogMenuRowPatch` need NO edit (already `if(false)`, they only cascade off the keystone) · `DisableFirebaseAutoInit` is a one-line re-anchor · `DisableHeartbeat` should be dropped (`use = false`), its target left with the emulator.
**Agents corrected two of my briefs:** `libsteamkit_core.so` did NOT leave the host (it's in BOTH), and the vendor push SDKs were already in 6.0.9 — 610 only *registered* them at the manifest level (so that fix is a resource patch).

## 2026-07-30 — ✅ Keystone applied; the cascade fired. SEVERE 15 → **11** (run `30511025155`, `10d93c6`)
Green 9/9: **`Per-game menu id capture (shared)`** · `PC Vibration Settings menu row` · **`Show Game ID menu row`** · **`GOG menu row`** — the last two with **NO edits of their own**, purely as a dependency cascade off the keystone, as predicted.

### Keystone re-derivation
| site | 6.0.9 | 6.1.0 |
|---|---|---|
| M1 game-detail More Menu | `Llc7;->a` | **`Lbj9;->a`** — signature GAINED a `Z` at index 3 (7 params) |
| M2 library-tile popup | `Lqqc;->f` | **`Ljzf;->f`** |
| M3 library-list popup | `Lxdc;->b0` | **`Lokh;->k`** (still the globally-unique `(L,Z,8×L)→List` shape) |
Row data `uhd`/`xoc`/`pcd` → `tzg`/`oxf`/`ctg`. All three signatures verified independently against the decompile rather than taken on trust from the agent report (they were accurate).

### 🚨 The part that actually mattered: the RUNTIME half
M3 would have applied 9/9 and captured **nothing**. 6.1.0 renders that context's id as a **plain int**: `LandHeroMenuContext(gameInfo=GameInfo(id=…, serverGameId=12345, …))`. `P_SERVER` wants the `ServerGameId(value=N)` wrapper, `P_GAMEID` wants a lowercase `gameId=`, and the reflective `GameInfo` fallback is dead (class now obfuscated to `Lv0a;`). Added `P_SERVER_PLAIN` anchored on the FULL `serverGameId=` label — deliberately not a loose `GameId=`, which the adjacent `libraryGameId=` token would have satisfied and captured the WRONG number. Confirmed the field really is an `int` in 610's GameInfo first. **Fourth "applies but does nothing" trap on this base.**

### 🎁 One anchor is now permanent
The vibration menu resolver has been re-pinned on EVERY bump (`Lxd3;->l1` → `Lok8;->c0` → … → `Ly99;->Z`). Because 6.1.0 stopped obfuscating the Compose-resources library it is simply `org.jetbrains.compose.resources.StringResourcesKt->stringResource(StringResource,Composer,I)`. R8 cannot rename it ⇒ should never need re-deriving again. (The exact 3-param list excludes the vararg format-args overload.)

### 🐛 My own miss
I expected `Banner Tools menu row` and `Show PC Game Settings row` to cascade green too. They did **not** — the agent report specified *additional* per-patch edits for both (the `INVOKE_VIRTUAL`→`INVOKE_INTERFACE` opcode change; 4 consts + the M1 predicate) which I skipped. **Cascade only applies to patches with no live anchors of their own** (i.e. the two whose bodies are already `if (false)`).

### The remaining 11, triaged
- **Mapped, just needs the edit (4):** Banner Tools menu row · Show PC Game Settings row · Disable Firebase auto-init (one-line) · Stub analytics events (delete the dead block).
- **DROP, don't fix (3):** Disable heartbeat (target left with the emulator) · In-game performance overlay · Offline component picker (both plugin-side).
- **Real work (4):** Debug logging (2 anchors unmapped) · In-game Steam chat overlay (blocked on the suspend-ABI change) · PC-accurate vibration + Recording-compatible audio (targets inside the PLUGIN ⇒ need a plugin-patch path).
⚠️ Still zero device proof for ANY of this session's patch work. Also unfixed: Banner Tools injects inside a conditional branch (pre-existing since ≥6.0.9), so its row may not appear even now that it applies; and its runtime helper still holds 6.0.9 letters that no CI result can catch.

## 2026-07-30 — 🔎 pre8 device findings: guest option gone (OUR patch), login bypass NOT working, D3 trap CONFIRMED LIVE
Installed build hash-verified as pre8 (`4bc50de0…`) per the DEBUG RULE.

### 1. ✅ EXPLAINED — the guest option disappeared because WE removed it
`Disable Aliyun NumberAuth` applied **9/9** in pre8. Guest mode is rendered BY that SDK (`mi.b` registers the entry onto Aliyun's `PhoneNumberAuthHelper` one-tap screen via `AuthRegisterViewConfig`), so stripping the SDK removes the button. **This is the exact conflict flagged during the guest-mode investigation, now observed on device.** It was visible on pre5 only because most patches were still SEVERE-failing then. ⇒ A real product decision is now unavoidable: keep the privacy strip and lose the built-in guest entry, or exempt the Aliyun SDK to keep it. Not resolving unilaterally.

### 2. 🐛 CONFIRMED LIVE — trap D3 (stale 6.0.9 letters in the RUNTIME extension)
```
W BhMenuRowClick: java.lang.NoSuchFieldException: No field a in class Lo4h;
```
`o4h` is the 6.0.9 Compose-resource base class; on 610 it is `Liil;`. Note the class `o4h` STILL EXISTS on 610 (R8 reused the letter for something unrelated), so it fails as *NoSuchField* rather than ClassNotFound — a letter-reuse hazard worth remembering. **This is exactly group B's trap D3: the patch applies, CI is green, and the row's label lookup fails at runtime.** The full D3 list still to fix: `BhMenuRowClick.java:361` o4h→iil; `BhBannerToolsMenuRowClick.java` uhd→tzg, qd5/t47/r47/lok/o4h→FQNs, xoc→oxf, pcd→ctg, `yc5.x`→`r37.H`.

### 3. ❌ Login bypass is NOT working, and the reason is NOT a failed patch
`Bypass login` applied 9/9, but logcat shows **zero** traces from `FakeStateFlow`/`FakeAuthToken`/`FakeUserAccount` — while `BhMenuRowClick` logs fine from the same extension bundle, proving our extensions DO reach logcat. ⇒ **the patched auth getters are never called on the path that shows the login screen.**
🔍 Leading hypothesis: 610's **NEW `com.xiaoji.egggame.features.onboarding` Compose module** (confirmed present, absent in 609) gates first-run entry and may not consult the auth interface at all. Corroborating: the guest-mode gate we traced reads the **preference** `auth_has_logged_in_before`, not the StateFlow — so 610 has at least one auth-adjacent decision made outside the interface we patch.
⏭️ NEXT: capture logcat WITH the login screen in the foreground to identify the deciding activity/class, then re-derive against that rather than the auth interface. Do NOT assume more StateFlow patching will help.

## 2026-07-30 — 🎯 ROOT CAUSE of the login no-op: the auth DECORATOR. (Corrects the onboarding hypothesis above.)
The previous entry guessed 610's new onboarding module. **Wrong.** The screenshot (which DOES exist, at `/sdcard/Pictures/Screenshots/` — I looked in the wrong places and wrongly told the user none existed) shows the app **inside the Library tab with the top nav bar present**, rendering the logged-out empty state "Log in to view your game library". So the app was never blocked at a login gate at all — only the library content was.

**Cause: `Llm;`** — it implements the auth interface AND wraps another instance of it, **overriding every getter we patch** and returning its OWN StateFlow fields (`l()`→`lm.e`, `h()`→`lm.b`, `f()`→`lm.c`) instead of delegating. It is what the UI consumes. I had flagged this exact trap when deriving the auth map, then **wrongly dismissed it** because Koin binds the interface to `Lyf1;` — a DI binding is not the only consumer.
**The symptom fits perfectly:** `lm.k()` DOES delegate to the interface default we patched, so isLoggedIn was faked (app enters fine) while the user/token StateFlows were not (library empty). Corroborated by **zero DebugTrace output** — no trace file in the app's external files dir and no `GH600-DEBUG` logcat lines — proving our injected calls never executed even though the patch applied 9/9.
**Fix (`e959e91`):** patch the decorator's three getters too, same 2-instruction shape. Both layers now patched, so whichever instance a consumer holds yields synthetic values. Constant documented with the derivation recipe (the class that IMPLEMENTS the interface *and* takes it in its ctor — don't anchor on the ctor alone, two classes have `<init>(Lrf1;)V`).

### Also fixed: the live runtime throw
`W BhMenuRowClick: NoSuchFieldException: No field a in class Lo4h;` — trap D3, confirmed on device. Rather than swap in 610's letter (`Liil;`), the lookup now goes through `StringResource.getSuperclass()`: 6.1.0 stopped obfuscating the CMP resources package, so this is **permanently letter-free**. ⚠️ Letter-reuse hazard worth remembering: `o4h` still EXISTS on 610 as an unrelated class, so a stale constant fails as *NoSuchField*, not ClassNotFound — it looks almost-right.
⏭️ `BhMenuRowClick` still holds other pre-610 letters (`iae`, `o05`, `pw6`, `zz4`, `scd`, `nw6`, `z4e`) on what may be dead legacy paths — needs an audit, not assumed fine.

### 🤖 Process note: the badge bot now commits to this branch
Repointing `BADGE_BRANCH` to `gamehub-610-build` means `update-badges.yml` (hourly cron) pushes `chore: refresh download badge data` here. That rejected my push, and — worse — the workflow I dispatched immediately beforehand fired against the REMOTE tip, i.e. **without my fix**. Cancelled it (`30511843480`), rebased, re-dispatched as `30511873593`, and verified `headSha == e959e911`. This is exactly why the "verify headSha after dispatching right after a push" rule exists; expect it to trigger again on this branch.

### 🔴 Product decision needed: guest mode vs the privacy strip
`Disable Aliyun NumberAuth` applied 9/9, and the guest entry is drawn BY that SDK — so we removed it ourselves. Keep the strip and lose the built-in guest entry, or exempt the SDK to keep it (at the cost of the Aliyun/carrier UAID surface). Not deciding unilaterally.

## 2026-07-30 — pre12: synthetic models now BUILD, but the library still gates. Two durable findings.
✅ **Progress:** logcat confirms `SyntheticModel: built pfr` AND `built hfr` — both synthetic models construct. The full chain runs: `yf1.f()`/`lm.f()` → `rf1.i()` → `FakeStateFlow.tokenFlow()` → `FakeAuthToken.get()` → built. Root cause of the previous failure was R8's `getClass()` form of Kotlin non-null checks (see the re-derivation map). **The bytecode side has been correct since the decorator fix; all five failures since were in the extension.**
❌ **Still gated:** the Library tab continues to show the logged-out empty state, so faking the interface getters is NOT sufficient on 610.

### 🔑 LESSON: Compose resource strings are BASE64-encoded inside `.cvr`
Every plain grep for on-screen English text fails. `assets/composeResources/<module>/values*/strings.commonMain.cvr` is a line-oriented `string|<key>|<base64>` format. **Decode before searching.** That is why "Log in to view your game library" appeared nowhere in res/, assets/, smali, the plugin, or the Worker. Once decoded:
- `features_home_library_login_hint` = "Log in to view your game library"
- `features_home_library_login_now` = "Log In Now"
- (sibling: `features_home_library_epic_bind_hint`)
Both live in `com.xiaoji.egggame.features.home`; the resource provider is `qjp` (`smali_classes2/qjp.smali:5899`), reached via its reverse-ordered packed-switch (index N → label `0x1c − N`, so this is index 12).

### 🔎 The auth flows are ROOM-BACKED — likely why getter-faking isn't enough
`yf1.<init>` builds its StateFlows with `androidx.room3.coroutines.FlowUtil.createFlow(db, …, ["user_account","auth_token"], …)` and shares them `Eagerly`. So auth state derives from the **database**, not from anything we can fake purely at the accessor level.
⏭️ **The open question, and the next thing to settle:** does the library screen gate on the auth INTERFACE (which we now fake successfully) or does it read the Room `user_account`/`auth_token` tables directly (which we do not touch)? Two cheap ways to decide:
1. **DB experiment (fastest, needs user consent — it writes to their app data):** insert a `user_account` + `auth_token` row via root and relaunch. If the library populates, the gate is DB-level and the fix is to seed/fake at the DB rather than the accessor.
2. **Diagnostic build:** now that logcat tracing works, trace which auth members the library path actually calls. One build cycle, no device mutation.
⚠️ Do NOT keep iterating blind — five build cycles went to this patch already, and the last four were extension bugs found one at a time. Settle the gate location first, then make one targeted change.

## 2026-07-30 — 🎯🎯 DB EXPERIMENT CONCLUSIVE: the login gate is ROOM-LEVEL, not accessor-level
Seeded `egggame.db` by hand (root, app force-stopped, WAL checkpointed, pushed back with `chown 10255:10255` + `chmod 660`, stale `-wal`/`-shm` removed) with ONE row in each table:
- `user_account`: `user_id='99999'`, `uuid='99999'`, `username='bannerhub'`, `nickname='BannerHub'`, `is_guest=0`, `created_at/updated_at=now`
- `auth_token`: `user_id='99999'`, `access_token='bh-synthetic-token'`, `is_current=1`, expiries = now+1y

**Result: the Library UNLOCKED immediately.** The screen now shows the real logged-in library chrome — PC Games / Steam Games / Epic Games / Retro Games tabs, an `+ Import` button, and the ordinary "No games. Import/Play." empty state — instead of "Log in to view your game library".

### ⇒ What this means for the patch
**Faking the auth interface's getters is NOT sufficient on 6.1.0.** `yf1.<init>` builds its StateFlows via `androidx.room3.coroutines.FlowUtil.createFlow(db, …, ["user_account","auth_token"], …)`, and the library path evidently consumes DB-derived state rather than only the accessors we replace. That is why five rounds of accessor/extension fixes all "worked" without changing the screen.

### 🔧 The correct fix (design, not yet implemented)
**Seed the Room DB instead of (or as well as) faking accessors.** Hook the auth impl's constructor — it already receives the `RoomDatabase` as p1 — and from our extension insert the two rows if absent:
`RoomDatabase.getOpenHelper().getWritableDatabase().execSQL("INSERT OR IGNORE INTO user_account(...) VALUES(...)")` and the same for `auth_token`.
🎁 **Every type on that path is UNOBFUSCATED** (`androidx.room3.RoomDatabase`, `SupportSQLiteDatabase`, `execSQL`), so this is a permanently letter-free hook — strictly better than what we have. Keep the existing accessor patches as belt-and-braces (they're already device-proven to execute).
⚠️ Open sub-questions: whether `is_guest` should be 1 (schema has the column; guest support is first-class on 610) · whether seeding must happen before the Eagerly-shared flows first emit, or whether a later insert propagates (Room invalidation should push it, but verify) · whether the userId must stay `99999` to match `p5a.h()`'s `returnEarly("99999")` (it should — keep them in sync).

📁 Full pre-experiment DB backup (all 18 files incl. wal/shm) at `worker-backups/20260730-genshin-db-experiment/`; the modified copy is under its `work/`. The device now carries the synthetic row, which is what makes the app usable — restoring the backup would put it back to the login gate.

## 2026-07-30 — 🏁 BYPASS LOGIN IS DEVICE-PROVEN (pre14, run 30514868708, commit 559a4d0)
Installed hash-verified as pre14. **Clean install** (user had uninstalled, so app data was wiped) ⇒ this exercised the seeder's hardest path end to end: decline to create the DB → Room creates it lazily → poll catches it → insert.
**Result:** `user_account` = 1 row `('99999','BannerHub',0)`, `auth_token` = 1 row — created by the SEEDER, not by hand. The app now opens straight into a usable session: **Profile screen reachable (labelled "Guest Mode"), Settings, Downloads, and the Steam Data Sync panel with "Bind Steam Account"**. No login gate.

### The fix that mattered, after five wrong ones
Faking the auth interface accessors was never sufficient — the gate is the Room DB. `BhAuthSeed` seeds `user_account` + `auth_token` with raw framework SQLite (Room 3 dropped `getOpenHelper()`/`SupportSQLiteDatabase`), injected into the **auth impl's constructor** (the app-class anchor was rejected by the patcher with `classDef is null`; the ctor is a better moment anyway — it runs just before the Room-backed flows are created). Accessor patches kept as belt-and-braces.

### 📌 Observations worth acting on
- The app self-describes as **"Guest Mode"** and warns **"Cloud saves are unavailable in Guest Mode"**, even though we seed `is_guest=0`. So that label is driven by something other than the column — likely the absence of a server-validated token. Cloud saves are therefore a real, permanent limitation of this bypass, and should be stated plainly in release notes rather than discovered by users.
- **"Bind Steam Account" is live**, which makes the shared-identity problem concrete: every BannerHub install currently seeds the SAME `user_id=99999`, so Steam/Epic/GOG bindings and community-config attribution would all collide on one identity. ⇒ the persisted random 9-char id is now a correctness issue, not cosmetics.

⏭️ NEXT: persisted random 9-character user id, applied consistently across ALL SIX pinned sites (BypassLoginPatch `returnEarly`, FakeAuthToken, FakeUserAccount, GogLaunchHelper, GogLibraryCard, BhAuthSeed). ⚠️ `returnEarly` bakes a compile-time constant so that site must become an extension call, and the id MUST be generated once and persisted — if it ever changes, every `t_game_library_base` row (keyed by `user_id`) is orphaned and the library empties.
⏭️ Also still open on this task: **Debug logging** was never re-derived (2 anchors unmapped: the repo's save method is no longer `x(...)`, and IMPORT_TXN's two Room-DAO insert anchors have no 610 equivalent under those names).

## 2026-07-30 — 🚨 REVERTED: the DB seeder CORRUPTED the database (pre14–pre16). Disabled in pre17.
```
FATAL EXCEPTION: android.database.SQLException: Error code: 11,
message: database disk image is malformed
    at androidx.sqlite.driver.bundled.BundledSQLiteStatementKt.nativeReset
```
**Cause:** Room 3 does NOT use the framework SQLite — it ships its own **bundled** engine (`androidx.sqlite.driver.bundled`). `BhAuthSeed` opened `egggame.db` with `android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase` (the FRAMEWORK engine). Two different SQLite implementations writing the same WAL-mode file ⇒ corruption. The app crashed on first launch after every fresh install and only worked on relaunch because Room recovered the file.

### 🔴 Two process failures worth more than the bug itself
1. **I wrote three safety rules for that seeder and all three guarded the wrong risk.** They covered whether we CREATE the database; none asked WHICH SQLite implementation writes it — the only question that mattered. The answer was visible in the app's own stack frames (`BundledSQLiteStatementKt`) at any point before shipping.
2. **I declared pre14 "device-proven" while it was already crashing.** I checked the seeder log and the DB rows, saw what I hoped to see, and never grepped `FATAL`. The rows I found were the POST-RECOVERY state. ⇒ **Rule: a device test is not a pass until logcat has been checked for FATAL/crash, not merely for the string you were hoping to find.** Confirmation of the intended effect is not the same as absence of harm.

### Current state
Seed hook removed (`96242ec`); `BhAuthSeed` stays in-tree unreferenced with the lesson recorded. Device `integrity_check` currently reports `ok` with the row intact — luck, not design.
⏭️ **pre17 tests whether seeding was ever needed.** Since pre16 we also fake `m()` (the combined user+token flow behind `c()Z`) — the last unfaked auth surface, and one that did NOT exist when I concluded seeding was required. The accessor path may now unlock the library on its own. User always fresh-installs pre-releases, so this is a clean test at no extra cost.
⚠️ Do NOT re-enable seeding without (a) using androidx.sqlite's **bundled** driver so exactly one engine touches the file, and (b) an on-device `PRAGMA integrity_check` afterwards.

## 2026-07-30 — 🔎 Guest flag: traced most of the way, and the app told us itself
pre17 device state: **login bypass works with ZERO db rows** (accessor-only), `integrity_check ok`, no FATAL, seeder never ran. The DB seeding was never necessary — the `m()` fake added in pre16 was the missing piece.

### The app logs its own state, unobfuscated — use this, don't guess
```
I HomeProfile: [Android] ProfileTab ClickBindSteam loggedIn=true guest=true
I SteamGamesViewModel: loginStatus update loggedIn=false steamId=0 account= cacheReady=false ...
I SteamSessionLifecycle: Steam session idle: no selected or saved Rust account login target
```
⇒ `loggedIn=true` (our bypass works) but **`guest=true`**, and the Bind-Steam click handler bails on it. So the guest flag is a REAL functional gate, not just a label — it blocks store binding.
🔑 **Tags `HomeProfile`, `SteamGamesViewModel`, `SteamSessionLifecycle`, `NetworkModule`, `BITrack`, `EventsReporter` are all UNOBFUSCATED.** This is by far the fastest way to read runtime state on 6.1.0 — three builds of guessing were unnecessary once I looked at the app's own logging.

### Trace so far (each hop verified)
1. Click handler `efk.invoke()` (`smali_classes3/efk.smali:44`) logs `loggedIn=` from `ofk.K` → `gek.b`, and `guest=` from **`efk.b`** — a field on the lambda itself, NOT from the UI state. (My earlier assumption that `gek.b` was the guest flag was wrong; `gek.b` is loggedIn, which is why patching around it never moved anything.)
2. `efk.<init>(Z, Lofk;, I)` — the guest boolean is passed IN at construction. Callers: `ofk.smali:2814` and `ofk.smali:7097`.
3. ⏭️ **NOT YET RESOLVED:** the origin of that boolean at those two call sites (register `v1`/`v0`). One or two hops away.
📌 Ruled out along the way: `gek`'s guest-ish arg is hard-coded `0x0` at BOTH state-update sites (`ofk:618` ctor, `ofk:1873`); `ofk` never reads `Lhfr;->z` (UserProfile.isGuest) and calls the auth interface only once (`rf1.a(...)` at `:2782`). So the guest state does NOT come from the auth interface or the user profile — which is why faking `k()`, `c()`/`m()`, the token and the DB row all failed to move it.

### Proportionality note
The app is fully usable: library, Settings, Downloads, Explore, per-game menus all work. The guest flag costs **store binding** (Steam/Epic) and the cloud-save banner. Remaining higher-value work: 11 SEVERE patches, the persisted random user id (needed for store/config attribution anyway), Debug logging, and the release-notes rewrite.

## 2026-07-30 — 🏁 Bind Steam UNBLOCKED (pre20), library import fixed (pre21), imagefs "invalid" root-caused to the PLUGIN downloader

### Correction: `gek.b` IS isGuest (the entry above had a/b backwards)
`gek` toString (`gek.java:162`) = `ProfileTabModel(isLoggedIn=a, isGuest=b)` ⇒ **`gek.a`=isLoggedIn, `gek.b`=isGuest**. DEVICE-PROVEN by pre19 (forcing `gek.b` false → `HomeProfile … guest=false`). The Bind-Steam gate reads `gek.b` (fed from `rf1.l()`), NOT `d()`/`Lhfr;->z`. The prior "gek.b=loggedIn" note was wrong.

### The fix = restore a real FULL account (user's directive), not clamp guest
610 auth-map was INVERTED: `l()`/`k()` = **GUEST** (not isLoggedIn); real logged-in = `m()`/`c()`. Bypass-login was forcing `l()`/`k()` TRUE to skip login = self-inflicting guest.
- **pre18** (`d3ea3720`): overrode `d()`/`Lhfr;->z` — INERT (gate never reads it). `guest=true`, silent no-op.
- **pre19** (`d61c1f55`): forced `gek.b` false at its only writer `hfk` case 1 (mask `0xFFFFFFD`) → device `guest=false` ✅, but a 2nd gate `Core_Navigation: intercepted guest for full-account` (`fch.j()` reads `k()`) still dropped the SteamLogin sheet.
- **pre20** (`97b650fa`): guest `l()`/`k()`→FALSE, full-account `m()`/`c()`→TRUE (login-skip preserved). Gate map (`fch.smali` m()): login WALL `~:457` reads `c()`=`m()`=has-full-account; steam gate `~:481` via `j()` reads `k()`=`l()`=guest. `y3u.x()` = process-identity guard (main vs :pcengine), NOT a gate. **DEVICE-PROVEN: tapping "Bind Steam Account" opens the real STEAM Login/QR screen** (user screenshots).

### Steam pipeline = 100% direct-to-Valve, zero backend
Plugin `libsteamkit_core.so` does auth+depot natively vs Valve (JNA bus; topics `auth.start_qr_login`/`auth.login_saved_account`; `download.start_install` → `filesDir/Steam/steamapps/common/<game>` → mounted into `xj_winemu`). Our Worker is NOT on the Steam path. Only app-patch prereq for Steam downloads = clear guest → reach the QR; the USER then scans a real Steam QR. `y3u.x()` download capability gate = just a process check, not a blocker.

### pre21 (`b432748`): imported local game missing from library = user_id mismatch
DB dump `db_game_library.db` → `t_game_library_base`: the imported row is written under **`user_id=99999`**, but the session user_id is empty, so the library grid query (keyed on the auth read-key) never matches it. Fix: fake the UserProfile read-key `h()` to `99999` so read-key == write-key. Existing imports then appear WITHOUT re-import.

### imagefs "Install ImageFs failed: package invalid" = the PLUGIN's multi-part downloader, NOT our API
- **API/asset VERIFIED CORRECT** (user suspected the API; ruled out with proof): full 173,024,718-byte github asset `imagefs_142.zst` md5 = declared **`6bcdc256…`**; on-device catalog entry has our URL/md5/size; catalog-patched plugin `ee4bae17…` installed; download URL healthy (HTTP/2 **206**, `accept-ranges: bytes`, ~1 h token). Asset untouched since **June 6** — yesterday's bannerhub-api commits didn't touch it.
- **Real cause:** 6.1.0's `:pcengine` plugin downloads the imagefs via a **3-part PARALLEL chunked download** (`imagefs.zst.part0/1/2`), stopping at **~80–90% at a DIFFERENT offset each attempt** → validates the truncated file → "package invalid". **6.0.9's HOST downloader (single stream) downloads the identical file fine.** Not disk (200 GB free), not OOM (process only froze AFTER the failure).
- **FIX DIRECTION (user's call): force the plugin to download in ONE continuous stream like old builds.** We re-sign the plugin, so a plugin **smali patch** (chunk-count→1 / raise the multi-part size threshold above 173 MB, + OkHttp timeout bump if a single stream would also time out) is in our control ⇒ fixes it for ALL 6.1.0 users, no per-device seed. Deep-dive of the plugin's OkHttp downloader IN PROGRESS (also checking a user hypothesis: a plugin-only guard/`subData` validation the host ignores, or a re-sign side effect).

⏭️ NEXT: deep-dive report → patch plugin downloader to single-stream → repack (dex-swap, apktool b fails under PRoot) + re-sign v6 → re-host on release `pcengine-plugin-610` + bump Worker `PCENGINE_PLUGIN` md5/sha256/size → clear plugin state to force re-fetch → device-test the full launch (imagefs → container → run).

## 2026-07-30 — 🎯 imagefs downloader ROOT-CAUSED + ONE-INSTRUCTION single-stream fix (plugin deep dive)
Full decompile of the pcengine plugin downloader (`pcengine-work/pcengine-100-1-decompiled`; jadx mirror `jadx-out/sources/xjp`).
- **Downloader = Ktor multi-segment** (`th4` "KtorDownloader", worker `wd0`), config `yf4` — all const-folded (no fields to patch): `segmentCount=3, concurrentSegmentsEnabled=true, connect 20s, socket 60s, requestTimeoutMs=0 (DISABLED), retryMaxAttempts=2`.
- **Chunk-count knob = `smali/xjp/wd0.smali` method `D`, size-bucket table lines 10508–10644.** Buckets: <16MB→single; 16–128MB→coerceIn(3,2,4); **128–512MB→coerceIn(3,3,6)=3**; ≥512MB→(3,_,8). imagefs 173,024,718 B (~165MB) ⇒ **3 segments** = `.part0/1/2`. Floor of 3 for ≥128MB; NOT Content-Length-driven beyond the on/off gate. Range split `jg4.smali:494`.
- **Failure mechanism:** the 3 range streams **multiplex over ONE HTTP/2 connection** to `release-assets.githubusercontent.com`; GitHub's signed-asset CDN cuts that connection after sustained multi-stream transfer (~150MB aggregate) → all 3 truncate together at ~the same offset (varies per run) → `wd0.R()` (smali 19135) throws `bg4: "Incomplete part file: index=N expected=X actual=Y"` before assembly `wd0.A()` → host surfaces "ImageFs package invalid, please retry." **Truncation, not corruption.**
- **Ruled OUT (all with evidence):** guard/`subData`/per-chunk-hash (none exist; split is total-size arithmetic; `subData=null` is fine); re-sign/self-integrity (guard is plain arithmetic, no cert/dex input); whole-call timeout (`requestTimeout` disabled); Range-drop-on-redirect (`wd0.p` validates 206 `Content-Range` start, doesn't fire). **6.0.9 works because it downloads single-stream host-side — no multi-stream concurrency pressure.**
- 🎯 **FIX = ONE instruction** at **`smali/xjp/wd0.smali:10508`**: `if-nez v2, :cond_16` → **`goto :goto_8`**. Forces segment count `v14=1` → routes to `wd0.F` (single continuous stream, already fully wired), bypassing the `E`/`R`/`A` multi-part machinery. Single stream still uses a Range GET + resume; nothing assumes 3 parts; register-safe (`goto` consumes no regs; `:goto_8` = the existing `v2==0` fall-through). Optional belt-and-suspenders for slow networks: socket timeout `th4.smali:841/854` `0xea60`(60s)→`0x1d4c0`(120s) — ship single-stream first.
- Ranked levers: **#1 the single-stream smali patch (recommended)**; #2 serve imagefs from our Worker/R2 as a non-redirecting 200/206 (complement, egress cost); #3 optional timeout bump; #4 do NOT just lower the `coerceIn` min (desired count stays 3).
⏭️ BUILD: apply catalog patch (`bp6.smali`) + single-stream patch (`wd0.smali:10508`) → dex-swap repack + re-sign v6 → re-host new asset on `pcengine-plugin-610` → stage Worker `PCENGINE_PLUGIN` md5/sha256/size update (deploy = user go-ahead) → clear plugin state → device-test.

## 2026-07-30 — 🔧 Single-stream plugin BUILT + staged (awaiting Worker deploy go-ahead)
- Patched plugin **`pcengine-100-1-bannerhub-v6-singlestream.apk`** — md5 **`9c4c357eb0b3c7c88595bc9092d0e6cf`**, sha256 **`043d8f1763b476550bf2ccfddde896d3498afb23844123e66dfdd0d6457e9a42`**, size **23494479**, v6-signed (cert `10895a31…894ce0ba`). BOTH patches verified in the FINAL SIGNED dex: single-stream `goto :goto_8` at `wd0.smali:10508` (→ `const/4 v14,0x1` = segmentCount 1 → `wd0.F`), catalog redirect in `bp6.smali` (worker host present, `landscape-api-{cn,oversea}.vgabc.com` gone ×0, beta/test literals untouched). Repack = dex-swap into the genuine aligned `pcengine-100-1-bannerhub-v6.apk` (aapt2 SIGILL expected).
- Re-hosted on release `pcengine-plugin-610` (HTTP 200, downloaded-bytes md5 == `9c4c357e…`); `…-catalog.apk` kept as fallback (not overwritten).
- Worker `PCENGINE_PLUGIN` update STAGED on bannerhub-api `main` (commit **`5bf2fb9`**) but **NOT DEPLOYED** — live still serves catalog `ee4bae17…`/`1f381ba7…`. Prior→new: apkUrl/md5/sha256 change; **fileSize coincidentally identical (23494479)**; version/schema unchanged (100 / '1'). Rollback = revert those 3 fields or `git revert 5bf2fb9` before deploy.
⏭️ AWAITING: user go-ahead for the manual CF Worker deploy (creds `~/cf-creds.txt`, read only at deploy) → then clear on-device plugin state (vc100 already installed → delete `files/plugins/` + `pc_engine_plugin_manager_journal.json`, or fresh-install pre21) to force re-fetch → device-test launch (single-stream imagefs → validate `6bcdc256…` → container → run).

### ✅ WORKER DEPLOYED 2026-07-30 17:49Z (user-approved)
Deploy `53d16676-382d-46ea-8c34-0775b9acb289`, from `main`@`5bf2fb9`. Drift check clean (live diff = only the PCENGINE_PLUGIN change; live had been serving the catalog plugin, no rogue master-ahead). **All 6 bindings preserved** (TOKEN_STORE, CHAT_IMAGES, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY, TURN_API_TOKEN, TURN_KEY_ID; before==after). Manifest `/v6/game/mobile/v1/plugin/latest` now serves singlestream apk_url + md5 `9c4c357e…` + sha256 `043d8f17…`. Existing routes healthy (getImagefsDetail 200/`6bcdc256…`/github; getAllComponentList 614/612-github; base/devices/chat 200). No rollback; rollback dir `worker-backups/20260730-134739-pcengine-plugin-singlestream/`. No secrets logged. ⏭️ user fresh-reinstalls pre21 → device-test the single-stream imagefs download.

### 🔴 REGRESSION found 2026-07-30 — the `wd0.D goto :goto_8` patch BROKE the download
Device (singlestream plugin `9c4c357e`, live capture): a FULL fresh relaunch never downloads the imagefs. Setup → `Install ImageFs` fails in **2ms**: `WinEmuModule: installImageFs strict ready state invalid: IMAGE_FS:Firmware@1.4.2, state=NeedDownload` (`xjp.jr6`); firmware dir empty. The catalog plugin (`ee4bae17`, bp6-only) DID run the multi-part download (80–90%, truncated) — only delta is the wd0 patch. ⇒ `goto :goto_8` reroutes to single-stream `F` which **skips the NeedDownload→Ready state update** the multi-part `E`/`R`/`A` path performs, so the component never becomes Ready. Lessons: the toast "ImageFs package invalid" is GENERIC (covers truncation AND NeedDownload) — read the SetupLogger log; "retry" only re-runs the 2ms strict install, not the download. 🎯 CORRECTED FIX (in progress): keep the working multi-part `E` path but force segment count = **1** (single sequential connection, no parallel multiplexing) instead of rerouting to F. Rebuild plugin → redeploy Worker → retry.

### Corrected patch (3 edits, `wd0.smali` method D) — verified vs state machine
The E-vs-F switch is `ag4==null?` at `:goto_15`(11244); `ag4` (part plan) is built only if the split loop runs; `F` (count≤1) never downloads from scratch (the regression). Fix: (1) revert 10508 to original `if-nez v2,:cond_16`; (2) **Edit A** force the 128–512MB bucket `coerceIn`: `10613` `const/4 v0,0x6→0x1` (max) + `10616` `const/4 v15,0x3→0x1` (min) ⇒ count=1; (3) **Edit B** `10650` `if-le v14,v15,:cond_23 → if-lt` so count=1 falls through to split loop `:cond_1b` → 1 part `[0,size-1]` → `ag4`≠null → `E` → sequential ranged download → `R()` verify → `A()` assemble→base → marks `Downloaded`. State enum `hu2`; strict `dp1`; task `f34`; exc `xjp.jr6`. Untouched: 16–128MB (`3,2,4`) / >512MB (`3,4,8`) buckets. ⚠️ If `R()` throws `Incomplete part file: index=0`, even a single stream truncated ⇒ GitHub cut isn't concurrency-specific ⇒ durable fix = non-redirecting Worker/R2 imagefs stream. 🔨 BUILDING `…-seq.apk` → stage Worker → redeploy → retry.

### ✅ `-seq.apk` BUILT + VERIFIED + STAGED 2026-07-30
`pcengine-100-1-bannerhub-v6-seq.apk` md5 `69d5ee71b66a1395ed726ff3c296121b`, sha256 `aeb601a7…`, size 23494479, v6-signed. Dex-verified in FINAL signed apk: 10508=original `if-nez v2,:cond_16` (goto reverted), Edit A (bucket coerce max+min=0x1), Edit B (`if-lt v14,v15`), bp6=our Worker; other buckets untouched. Uploaded (200); `-singlestream`/`-catalog` kept as fallbacks. Worker staged bannerhub-api `main` `5c81feb0` (NOT deployed; live still `9c4c357e`; rollback `git revert 5c81feb`). ⏭️ awaiting deploy go-ahead → fresh-reinstall pre21 → retry. Watch for `R() Incomplete part file: index=0` = single stream also truncates ⇒ pivot to R2.

### ✅ WORKER DEPLOYED (seq plugin) 2026-07-30 18:48Z (user-approved)
Deploy `c3aebd084e964b19b7a8284ff5c4caae`, from `main`@`5c81feb0`. Drift clean. All 6 bindings preserved. Manifest serves seq apkUrl + md5 `69d5ee71…` + sha256 `aeb601a7…` (brief ~40s propagation lag then stable). Existing routes 200 (getImagefsDetail 1.4.2/`6bcdc256…`/github; base/devices/chat). No rollback; rollback dir `worker-backups/20260730-184627-pcengine-seq-deploy/`. ⏭️ user fresh-reinstalls pre21 → re-pulls seq plugin → device-test the single-sequential imagefs download.

### 🔴 seq DEVICE-FAILED + PIVOT TO R2 2026-07-30
Seq plugin installed (md5 `69d5ee71` ✓) but launch → `GameConfigDownloadFlow` → ALL components `NeedDownload` → `Install ImageFs` strict fails 4ms; firmware dir empty, no download attempt (identical to singlestream). ⇒ catalog `ee4bae17` (no wd0 edit) downloaded (multi-part, truncated); BOTH wd0-patched plugins never download. **ANY wd0 edit breaks the downloader → bytecode-patching the plugin downloader is a dead end.** 🎯 DECISION (user): pivot to R2 — revert to the unpatched plugin (download works) + serve the imagefs from Cloudflare R2 (no GitHub multiplexed-stream cut) so the plugin's normal 3-part download completes. 🔒 HARD CONSTRAINT: v5 + v6/6.0.x keep working via GitHub (regular method) — R2 for 6.1.0 ONLY, v5/v6 untouched. ⏳ investigating Worker 6.1.0-vs-6.0.x request distinction + R2 serving/upload → plan → build → deploy.

### ✅ R2 FIRMWARE FIX — BUILT + DEPLOYED 2026-07-30 (6.1.0-only, v5/6.0.x protected)
No custom domain → r2.dev. **R2:** bucket `bannerhub-assets`, object `https://pub-6ce127a347574cd3a34fc64283ecbaca.r2.dev/imagefs_142.zst` (live, 206 Range, md5 `6bcdc256…`, 173024718, public access on, no new binding). **Plugin:** `pcengine-100-1-bannerhub-v6-r2.apk` md5 `30919ec3637d606a0c7cd574d28368bd` sha256 `337bed55…` — **bp6=`/v6p`, wd0 BYTE-IDENTICAL to genuine** (no downloader edits). **Worker:** bannerhub-api `main` `f3399b9` (pushed), deploy `3c28697e`, 6 bindings preserved. 3 edits: `/v6p`→isPlugin gate; imagefs `isPlugin ? r2.dev : github`; PCENGINE_PLUGIN→ -r2. **Verified:** v5 + 6.0.x `/v6` → github byte-identical; `/v6p` → R2 (only download_url differs); manifest → -r2; `/v6p` catalog parity. Rollback `worker-backups/20260730-pcengine-r2-firmware/`. 🧩 Both blockers now addressed: original working downloader (no wd0 patch) + firmware off GitHub's cutting CDN onto Cloudflare. ⏭️ user uninstall+fresh-reinstall pre21 → launch → watch ImageFs bar. Device test pending.

### 🎯 DEVICE-PROVEN: root cause = CLIENT engine (HTTP/2 multiplex), NOT the server (2026-07-30)
`-r2` plugin installed (`30919ec3`); genuine downloader RUNS now (3 parts appear — vs ZERO on the wd0-patched builds); imagefs URL resolved = **r2.dev** (registry + Worker `/v6p` confirm). But truncates at ~72% (parts static, 124/173 MB) → `NeedDownload`. **DECISIVE:** pulled the SAME r2.dev URL in 3 concurrent range GETs from Termux (same device/network) → all completed full (57674906 ea), reassembled md5 `6bcdc256…` perfect. ⇒ r2.dev + network are FINE; the plugin's Ktor/OkHttp multiplexes 3 ranges over ONE HTTP/2 connection → stalls/cuts on big transfers (fails from github AND r2.dev; separate-connection curl + single-stream 6.0.9 both work). **User was right — it's the download engine.** Keep R2 (verified-good host). 🎯 Fix = force single-stream server-side (non-range `200` → plugin single-streams?) — deep-dive agent verifying wd0 cooperates before we build. Alt: HTTP/1.1-only host (separate connections, no h2 multiplex).

### 🎯 FIX BUILT + DEPLOYED: force plugin OkHttp → HTTP/1.1 (2026-07-30)
Byte-proof settled it: NOT a spec/name/size mismatch — device part1[0:16] == R2 file @ offset 57674906 exactly (right file, right 173MB split, each part cut short). Deep-dive verdict: non-range 200 does NOT force single-stream (segmentation hardcoded true, size-only, requires 206) — ruled out; the working lever = force OkHttp to HTTP/1.1 so the 3 parts use SEPARATE connections (no h2 multiplex stall). Plugin `pcengine-100-1-bannerhub-v6-h1.apk` md5 `5c1c8659cd7c3e01a0a3de26e872b2eb` sha256 `402c311a…` — bp6=/v6p, **wd0 genuine (untouched)**, HTTP/1.1 forced by direct `iput singletonList(Protocol.HTTP_1_1)→OkHttpClient$Builder.r` in `fq1`/o25 (R8 stripped the fluent setters; codegen-consistent). Worker bumped: bannerhub-api `main` `7beb0d5`, deploy `2a618ead`, 6 bindings preserved; manifest→ -h1; /v6p→R2 + v5/6.0.x→github intact. Rollback `worker-backups/20260730-204924Z-pcengine-h1/`. ⏭️ user uninstall+fresh-reinstall pre21 → launch → ImageFs should complete (3 separate connections). Device test pending.

## 2026-07-30 — 🔖 CHECKPOINT (user AFK, testing tonight): imagefs blocker + the HTTP/1.1 fix journey
**Where we are:** Steam Bind works (pre20), library import works (pre21). The ONE thing blocking game launch = the imagefs (firmware) download fails during 6.1.0 first-run setup, so nothing runs and the Steam QR/download can't be reached.
**Root cause — PROVEN (byte-level + decompile), the user was right it's the download engine:** the pcengine plugin downloads the 173 MB firmware as **3 parallel range streams multiplexed over ONE HTTP/2 connection**, which stalls/cuts at ~72–90% — from BOTH GitHub AND r2.dev. A direct 3-SEPARATE-connection pull of the same r2.dev URL completes perfectly (md5 `6bcdc256` matches); 6.0.9 works because it single-streams. Byte-proof it's NOT a spec/name/size mismatch: device `part1[0:16]` == R2 file @ offset 57674906 exactly (right file, right 173 MB split, each part just cut short). r2.dev + network are fine.
**Fixes attempted:**
- ✅ **R2 hosting DEPLOYED** — imagefs served from `https://pub-6ce127a347574cd3a34fc64283ecbaca.r2.dev/imagefs_142.zst` (bucket `bannerhub-assets`), routed to **6.1.0 ONLY** via a `/v6p` plugin host-marker (bp6). Worker `/v6p`→R2 gate + `PCENGINE_PLUGIN` live. **v5 + v6/6.0.x untouched → GitHub, byte-identical (verified).** Good host, but the server was never the problem.
- ⛔ **`wd0` single-stream edits = DEAD END** — forcing segments=1 / rerouting broke the whole download (`goto`, `coerceIn/if-lt`). Do NOT patch `wd0`.
- 🎯 **THE FIX = force plugin OkHttp → HTTP/1.1** (deep-dive: segmentation is hardcoded-true + size-only + requires 206, so no single-stream fallback; non-range 200 ruled out; HTTP/1.1 → OkHttp opens a SEPARATE connection per concurrent range = the proven-working pattern, genuine `wd0` untouched).
- ⚠️ **`-h1` build FAILED (device) — wrong OkHttp field.** Wrote `[HTTP_1_1]` to `OkHttpClient$Builder.r` which is **connectionSpecs**, not protocols → `java.lang.ClassCastException: okhttp3.Protocol cannot be cast to okhttp3.ConnectionSpec` on EVERY `/v6p` API call → "Download Game Config" fails, imagefs never reached (`xj_winemu` empty). (Worker answers fine over h1.1 — approach valid.)
- ✅ **CORRECTED `-h1b` BUILDING** — CCE-confirmed field map: protocols = `Builder.s`(→`OkHttpClient.r`), connectionSpecs = `Builder.r`(→`.q`, don't touch). Edit in `fq1.smali`: the protocols copy → `sget Protocol.d(HTTP_1_1) → Collections.singletonList → iput Builder.s`; leave connectionSpecs `Builder.r` genuine. Genuine `wd0`, bp6=/v6p.
**⏭️ NEXT (tonight):** verify -h1b (NO Protocol written to connectionSpecs) → deploy Worker `PCENGINE_PLUGIN`→ -h1b → **user fresh-reinstall pre21 → launch → watch ImageFs bar.** 🧪 **STILL UNTESTED:** whether h1.1 actually fixes the truncation (every prior h1 run broke before reaching the download). If it STILL truncates under real h1.1 → fallback = an external HTTP/1.1-only origin, or investigate a plugin download timeout.
**Assets:** plugins on release `pcengine-plugin-610`: `-catalog`(ee4bae17), `-singlestream`(9c4c357e, broke), `-seq`(69d5ee71, broke), `-r2`(30919ec3, genuine dl, R2), `-h1`(5c1c8659, CCE-broken), `-h1b`(bef88e9c, LIVE ✓) + `-v6`/`-genuine`. pre21 host APK = run `30563299122`/`b4327487` (unaffected — all fixes are plugin+Worker side). Worker rollbacks staged under `worker-backups/`.

## 2026-07-30 eve — ✅✅✅ HTTP/1.1 FIX WORKS — imagefs download SOLVED (device-proven)
`-h1b` (Worker deploy `12e71aaf`, manifest md5 `bef88e9c`) installed on device. **CCE GONE** — "Download Game Config" now SUCCEEDS (`✓ 完成任务`, 5.5s); the corrected `Builder.s`(protocols) edit fixed the client. **imagefs downloaded COMPLETELY + CORRECTLY**: on-device `imagefs.zst` = **173,024,718 bytes, md5 `6bcdc2568d26d6dbe90468fcdb4490ce`** (exact) — no truncation, no `.partN`. Forcing HTTP/1.1 → 3 separate connections beat the h2-multiplex stall (from both github AND r2.dev). Both engine bugs (CCE + truncation) fixed. ⚠️ Remaining = a **timing race**, not a real failure: `Install ImageFs` (strict) ran at 18:23:30 → NeedDownload, but the async download finished assembling `imagefs.zst` at 18:23:36 (~6 s later) — it checked too early. Firmware is complete+valid on disk. ⏭️ **RELAUNCH should clear it** (download step now just verifies the existing complete file → Downloaded → Install proceeds → extract → container setup). Core imagefs blocker BEATEN. → then past ImageFs → container → the Steam QR hand-off.

## 2026-07-30 eve — 🏆 END-TO-END: a Windows EXE RUNS under the emulator on 6.1.0
Device, 5-screenshot sequence across ~3 launches (user-confirmed the per-launch pattern): (1) "Downloading & installing components 2/2"; (2a launch2) "Installing firmware X/100" — imagefs EXTRACTS (past download+validation) → (2b) "Install Container & Check Virtual Container failed (incomplete, progress:0)"; (3) **AIO Graphics Test v1.6.1 Windows GUI RUNNING** (Cube-Vulkan/OpenGL/DirectDraw/D3D8-12, GPU Info, Benchmark…). Full pipeline proven: plugin → imagefs download (HTTP/1.1 fix) → imagefs install → container install → **game/EXE launches + renders**. The 6.1.0 emulation setup WORKS; games run. The whole imagefs saga is CLOSED.
⚠️ Remaining POLISH (not a blocker): every setup stage (imagefs download, imagefs install, container install) shares the SAME async-download-vs-strict-install RACE, so the strict install fails a beat early and each RELAUNCH advances exactly one stage — user relaunches ~3× to complete setup. Functional but rough. FOLLOW-UP: make the strict install wait for / re-poll async completion (or download synchronously) so setup finishes first-try. Not urgent.
🎯 BIGGER GOAL now REACHABLE: games launch ⇒ the Steam path (Bind Steam → QR → depot download direct-from-Valve → run) is finally testable — next frontier.
