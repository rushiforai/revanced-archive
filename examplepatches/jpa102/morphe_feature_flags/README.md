# you want it? you find it!

this is `morphe_feature_flags`, a repository filled with collection of feature flags from apps patched with [Morphe](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches) (only applicable if it has **Feature Flags Manager** in Morphe settings → Miscellaneous, in the patched application)

if you find a bug at [`morphe-patches`](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches/issues) and identified a feature flag that somehow solves it, you can provide the flag to them and they could implement a solution for it

***

to get started, go to Debugging inside Miscellaneous at Morphe settings (example: youtube → settings → morphe → miscellaneous), then enable **Debug logging** and restart the app (like **end** the app from your recents, okay?)

on your restart, you will see the feature flags in numerical order. they are unreadable for sure but once you identify what it does based on blocking and unblocking them, you can start labeling them with a clear description (use a note app for example, on pc with [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) it's more convenient)

sometimes, flags are only specific to an app version. therefore you need to document their limitations and what version(s) they only appear. hell, they may even disappear in later app versions at any given time

***

you can either create your own repository for flags, or freely share them here so they're in one place

with that said, are you up for the challenge finding feature flags?
