"""
Searches GitHub for repositories that look like Revanced patch sources, then
verifies each candidate actually has a GitHub Release with a `.rvp` asset
attached (the real signal that it's a Revanced patch bundle, since Revanced
bundles are distributed as release assets, not regular repo files).

Steps:
  1. Code search for `patches-bundle.json` files (excludes forks)
  2. For each candidate repo, check its Releases API for any asset
     ending in `.rvp`
  3. Only repos that pass step 2 are kept

Results are merged with whatever is already in repos.txt (e.g. from
fetch_org_repos.py) and the de-duplicated, sorted list is written back out.

Note: GitHub's Search API requires authentication for decent rate limits
(code search: 10/min unauthenticated, higher with a token) and only
indexes the default branch of repos under a certain size, so this is a
best-effort discovery pass, not a guarantee of completeness.
